      <p>People hear about Friendly AI and say - this is one of the top three initial reactions:</p>
      <p>"Oh, you can try to tell the AI to be Friendly, but if the AI can modify its own source code, it'll just remove any constraints you try to place on it."</p>
      <p>And where does&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;decision come from?</p>
      <p>Does it enter from outside causality, rather than being an effect of a lawful chain of causes which started with the source code as originally written?&nbsp; Is the AI the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/rc/the_ultimate_source/">Author* source</a>&nbsp;of its own free will?</p>
      <p>A Friendly AI is not a selfish AI constrained by a special extra conscience module that overrides the AI's natural impulses and tells it what to do.&nbsp; You just build the conscience, and that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the AI.&nbsp; If you have a program that computes which decision the AI should make, you're&nbsp;<em>done</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ra/causality_and_moral_responsibility/">The buck stops immediately</a>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>At this point, I shall take a moment to quote some case studies from the Computer Stupidities site and Programming subtopic.&nbsp; (I am not linking to this, because it is a fearsome time-trap; you can Google if you dare.)</p>
      <blockquote><hr />
        <p>I tutored college students who were taking a computer programming course. A few of them didn't understand that computers are not sentient.&nbsp; More than one person used comments in their Pascal programs to put detailed explanations such as, "Now I need you to put these letters on the screen."&nbsp; I asked one of them what the deal was with those comments. The reply:&nbsp; "How else is the computer going to understand what I want it to do?"&nbsp; Apparently they would assume that since they couldn't make sense of Pascal, neither could the computer.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>While in college, I used to tutor in the school's math lab.&nbsp; A student came in because his BASIC program would not run. He was taking a beginner course, and his assignment was to write a program that would calculate the recipe for oatmeal cookies, depending upon the number of people you're baking for.&nbsp; I looked at his program, and it went something like this:</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Preheat oven to 350<br />20&nbsp; &nbsp;Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl<br />30&nbsp; &nbsp;Mix until smooth</p>
        <hr />
        <p>An introductory programming student once asked me to look at his program and figure out why it was always churning out zeroes as the result of a simple computation.&nbsp; I looked at the program, and it was pretty obvious:</p>
        <p class="excerpt">begin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; read("Number of Apples", apples)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; read("Number of Carrots", carrots)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; read("Price for 1 Apple", a_price)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; read("Price for 1 Carrot", c_price)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; write("Total for Apples", a_total)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; write("Total for Carrots", c_total)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; write("Total", total)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; total = a_total + c_total<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a_total = apples * a_price<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c_total = carrots * c_price<br />end</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Me:</span>&nbsp;"Well, your program can't print correct results before they're computed."<br /><span class="speaker">Him:</span>&nbsp;"Huh?&nbsp; It's logical what the right solution is, and the computer should reorder the instructions the right way."</p>
        <hr />
      </blockquote>
      <p>There's an instinctive way of imagining the scenario of "programming an AI".&nbsp; It maps onto a similar-seeming human endeavor:&nbsp; Telling a human being what to do.&nbsp; Like the "program" is giving instructions to a little ghost that sits inside the machine, which will look over your instructions and decide whether it likes them or not.</p>
      <p>There is no ghost who looks over the instructions and decides how to follow them.&nbsp; The program&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the AI.</p>
      <p>That doesn't mean the ghost does anything you wish for, like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/">genie</a>.&nbsp; It doesn't mean the ghost does everything you want the way you want it, like a slave of exceeding docility.&nbsp; It means your instruction&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the only ghost that's there, at least at boot time.</p>
      <p>AI is much harder than people instinctively imagined, exactly because you can't just&nbsp;<em>tell&nbsp;</em>the ghost what to do.&nbsp; You have to build the ghost from scratch, and everything that seems obvious to you, the ghost will not see unless you know how to make the ghost see it.&nbsp; You can't just&nbsp;<em>tell</em>&nbsp;the ghost to see it. &nbsp;You have to create that-which-sees from scratch.</p>
      <p>If you don't know how to build something that seems to have some strange ineffable elements like, say, "decision-making", then you can't just shrug your shoulders and let the ghost's free will do the job. You're left forlorn and ghostless.</p>
      <p>There's more to building a chess-playing program than building a really fast processor - so the AI will be really smart - and then typing at the command prompt "Make whatever chess moves&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;think are best."&nbsp; You might think that, since the programmers themselves are not very good chess-players, any advice they tried to give the electronic superbrain would just slow the ghost down.&nbsp; But there is no ghost.&nbsp; You see the problem.</p>
      <p>And there isn't a simple spell you can perform to - poof! - summon a complete ghost into the machine.&nbsp; You can't say, "I summoned the ghost, and it appeared; that's cause and effect for you."&nbsp; (It doesn't work if you use the notion of "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iv/the_futility_of_emergence/">emergence</a>" or "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ix/say_not_complexity/">complexity</a>" as a substitute for "summon", either.)&nbsp; You can't give an instruction to the CPU, "Be a good chessplayer!"&nbsp; You have to see inside the mystery of chess-playing thoughts, and structure the whole ghost from scratch.</p>
      <p>No matter how common-sensical, no matter how logical, no matter how "obvious" or "right" or "self-evident" or "intelligent" something seems to you, it will not happen inside the ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Unless</em>&nbsp;it happens at the end of a chain of cause and effect that began with the instructions that&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;had to decide on, plus any causal dependencies on sensory data that you built into the starting instructions.</p>
      <p>This doesn't mean you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/l9/artificial_addition/">program in every decision explicitly</a>. Deep Blue was a far superior chessplayer than its programmers.&nbsp; Deep Blue made better chess moves than anything its makers could have explicitly programmed - but not because the programmers shrugged and left it up to the ghost.&nbsp; Deep Blue moved better than its programmers... at the end of a chain of cause and effect that began in the programmers' code and proceeded lawfully from there.&nbsp; Nothing happened&nbsp;<em>just</em>because it was so obviously a good move that Deep Blue's ghostly free will took over, without the code and its lawful consequences being involved.</p>
      <p>If you try to wash your hands of constraining the AI, you aren't left with a free ghost like an emancipated slave.&nbsp; You are left with a heap of sand that no one has purified into silicon, shaped into a CPU and programmed to think.</p>
      <p><span class="marked">Go ahead, try telling a computer chip "Do whatever you want!"&nbsp; See what happens?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Because you haven't constrained it to understand freedom.</span></p>
      <p>All it takes is one single step that is&nbsp;<em>so obvious, so logical, so self-evident</em>&nbsp;that your mind just skips right over it, and you've left the path of the AI programmer.&nbsp; It takes an effort like the one I showed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/re/grasping_slippery_things/">Grasping Slippery Things</a>&nbsp;to prevent your mind from doing this.</p>

      <p>Aesthetics of Interruption</p>
      <p><a href="http://ctheory.net/ctheory_wp/loving-the-ghost-in-the-machine/#bio">Janne Vanhanen</a></p>
      <p>Ghosts</p>
      <p><span style="background: aqua;">In science fiction, ghosts in machines always appear as malfunctions, glitches, interruptions in the normal flow of things. Something unexpected appears seemingly out of nothing and from nowhere. Through a malfunction, a glitch, we get a fleeting glimpse of an alien intelligence at work. As electricity has become the basic element of the world we live in, the steady hum of power grids and their flowing immaterial essences slowly replacing the cogs and cranks of everyday machinery</span>, the ghostly rapport has also relocated into the domain of current fluctuations, radio interference and misread data.</p>
      <p>Early telegraph experimenters heard strange raps and clicks issuing from disturbances in Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field, seemingly communication from some other side; Thomas Edison tried to put together a radio device to address denizens of other worlds; Constantin Raudive, Raymond Cass and Friedrich J&cedil;rgenson spent hours and hours attempting to capture voices of the dead onto magnetic tape; radio antennas at Arecibo Observatory are pointed skywards, waiting for extraterrestrial signals. The presence of some outside force has always been supposed to be apparent through interference and interruption.</span></p>
      <p>Actual facts about these manifestations are not really important. The interesting thing is that every new medium seems to open up a new kind of outside, every new mode of perception leaving out, or even creating, something imperceptible, and on the other hand bringing out something previously out of reach. Erik Davis has named the outside boundary of electronic media as the <span style="background: aqua;">&ldquo;electromagnetic imaginary,&rdquo; meaning that many animistic or alchemistic notions of essential energies and life spirits have been translated into the concept of electricity, and remaining in the &ldquo;technological unconscious.&rdquo; Machines seem to be inhabiting some kind of life, even as it is an extension of ourselves.</span> The sheer uncanniness of a <span style="background: lime;">disembodied voice transmitting via telephone line</span>, as experienced by early telephone users, is quite hard to imagine now, but think of hearing a voice of a recently departed person on an answering machine.</span></p>
      <p>We can remember Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s words about electronic media having outered the central nervous system itself, thus making the world into a smooth plateau of perception. This rings true when considering digital media, which is characterized by its transparency, its smoothness. <span style="background: aqua;">Any type of information is de- and recodable into another format. This kind of flux and mutability of digital media makes it into an immersive enviroment, rather like sound.</span></span></p>
      <p>So far, however, our conception of electronic media seems to have been very visually dominated and tied up to the more general link between the visual and the rational, which has been prominent in Western thought. However, many thinkers have also&nbsp;<em>heard </em>something new coming from the explosion of new media since the 19</span><sup><span>th</span></sup>&nbsp;Century. McLuhan wrote about the acoustic quality of the electronic global village he saw coming. German philosopher Wolfgang Welsch, in his essay &ldquo;On the Way to an Auditive Culture?&rdquo; addresses the problem of oculacentrism of the Western philosophical tradition and tries to create a conception of an auditive form of thinking. How to think of sound itself when the epistemological focus of our thinking and our concepts is located in a seeing subject? With its temporality and immersiveness, sound seems to avoid clarity, categorization and objectivity. <span style="background: lime;">Light and sight reveal objects, sound is the result of processes, of something happening and of mistakes: there can&rsquo;t be glitches without processes. The whole notion of glitch is tied up to an &ldquo;auditive&rdquo; thoughtform, which approaches the world as a multiplicity of processes rather than a pre-set field of objects.</span></span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>The scratches and glitches of contemporary electronic music, its aesthetics of interruption and misuse, should be considered in relation to the ontology of the Outside, or its&nbsp;<em>hauntology</em>&nbsp;(to quote Derrida writing about hauntings and returnings). Contemporary thought has painstakingly strived to approach this outside of thought and perception. The subject and the world, if such separation can be made, are seen to be formed in complex interrations between both. The subject emerges from the processes of the world. Deleuze and Guattari give these processes a name: machines. <span style="background: aqua;">Machines are defined as &ldquo;a&nbsp;<em>system of interruptions</em>&nbsp;or breaks&rdquo; (AO 36), cutting and redirecting the energetic flows of preconscious world, which can be thought of as an infinitely complex assemblage of machines acting upon other machines acting upon others etc.</span> A subjectivity is emergent and residual, having only a limited perspective upon the underlying world of forces it inhabits. Looking at our surroundings we&nbsp;<em>recognize</em>&nbsp;things, we are creatures of habit and conventions. Thinking, ultimately a creative act, is not recognition but an encounter, violence to thought. Something comes from the outside that interrupts and grabs us and forces us outside of our habitual territory.</span></p>
      <p>By introducing the&nbsp;<em>refrain</em>&nbsp;Deleuze and Guattari have created a concept that illustrates the constantly shifting nature of relations between territorialized or habitual milieu and the chaos of the outside forces. A refrain, in the domain of music, can be described very vaguely as a rhythmic element, something marking out a territory amidst chaos: a nursery rhyme, a child&rsquo;s song to comfort oneself, a birdsong to stake out a territory? Refrain doesn&rsquo;t, however, have just a reactionary function against chaos; it is situated in the middle and has a potential to both reterritorialize and deterritorialize sound, constantly on the border of a territory. Art has posited itself onto this border. Or, <span style="background: aqua;">to paraphrase Deleuze and Guattari, all creative activity, whether it&rsquo;s art, philosophy or science, has to approach the outside of thought. To be able to create new ways to feel the world, new percepts and affects, one has to court the chaos and worship the glitch.</span></span></p>
      <p><strong><span>Machines</span></strong></p>
      <p>Contemporary electronic music has approached this outside of thought, or outside of music, by distancing itself from the hierarchy of Western classical music tradition, which has valuated certain musical structures (such as melody/harmony) over another qualities (rhythm, timbre) and posited the score as a transcendent compositional principle. Deleuze and Guattari observe the deterritorializing tendency of refrain in music:</span></p>
      <p><span>Certain modern musicians oppose the transcendental plan(e) of organization, which is said to have dominated all of Western classical music, to the immanent sound plane, which is always given along with that to which it gives rise, brings the imperceptible to perception, and carries only differential speeds and slownesses in a kind of molecular lapping:&nbsp;the work of art must mark seconds, tenths and hundredths of seconds. (MP 267)</span></p>
      <p>If art&rsquo;s quest is to bring the imperceptible to perception, music seeks to make audible the inaudible forces of time and duration, to bring out an immanent sound plane, a pure sound block, in which &ldquo;forms are replaced by pure modifications of speed.&rdquo; (MP 267) How does one manage to get away from the grip of musical forms while being still able to retain a plane of consistency; to not regress into undifferentiated chaos which couldn&rsquo;t hold any consistency? This is the question of the refrain.</span></p>
      <p>In order to become-other, one has to align with some outerior forces and create new machinic assemblages. That&rsquo;s why Deleuze and Guattari write that refrain isn&rsquo;t the origin of music but rather a means of preventing it, warding it off (MP 300). Becoming is an alliance. With music machines we have entered a new kind of musical alliance. Phonography, the art of recording sound, allows the production of a smooth sound plane, on which all relations between its various elements are immanent as recording extracts or constructs a block of time, a musical time that is present as sound penetrates our bodies, but emerges as a result from an (quasi)event which is distant from us spatially and temporarily.</span></p>
      <p>One can see the effect of recording or sound processing technology as having helped in breaking with the traditional musical notation and the ideal of a pure musical form. <span style="background: lime;">Once all sound has become recordable and reproducible by machines, we can be done away with the concept of music as residing, ultimately, in the score.</span> Phonography and electronic/digital media have flattened out the arborescent model of the actual sound&rsquo;s relation to a higher structure, that is, the composition itself as actualized in various levels of perfection in the performances of musicians. From machinic point of view (or hearing) there&rsquo;s no difference between voice and noise, we have only sonic stratum and various means to manipulate that sound matter.</span></p>
      <p>The concept of frequency, according to German media philosopher Friedrich Kittler, brought about by recording technology, allows music to break with the Old European tradition of pythagorean harmony and notation as the preserver of clear and pure sounds (in opposition to the chaotic noise of the world). Since the 19</span><sup><span>th</span></sup>&nbsp;Century sound has been recordable, vibrations in a carrying medium transferable to a recording surface. <span style="background: lime;">&ldquo;The phonograph does not hear as our ears that have been trained immediately to filter voices, words and sounds out of noise; it registers acoustic events as such.&rdquo;</span> (Kittler 23) The phonograph hears sounds <span style="background: lime;">acousmatically, without a relation to the origin of a sound.</span></span></p>
      <p>Using the concepts of Deleuze and Guattari, we can state that the phonograph deterritorializes sound, flattens down the hierarchical organization of music into a rhizome, which is an open, multiple and temporal form of organization and subsceptible to constant de- and recoding. The act of recording is in one way already a creative act of framing and selection. Any recording is a whole in itself, all its characteristics are immanent to itself, without an essential relation to an outerior or higher symbolic order. <span style="background: lime;">However, up until the 1960s and the expansion of recording studio technologies, record was generally regarded as referring to an original acoustic event, a performance, which would have more ontologic value (i.e. &ldquo;realness&rdquo;) than mere representation of it. Multitrack tape machines make that stance irrelevant; studio-as-instrument does away with acoustic realism. A particular soundscape, experienced as a unified whole, could have been assembled during many different takes and places, or wouldn&rsquo;t have to result from any acoustic events, as in computer music. Through the mixing board and the master tape, the record is the stratified surface of sound.</span></span></p>
      <p>I hear no great conceptual divide between various music machines. Whatever means there are available for recording acoustic phenomena or presenting sound, no matter what the source, making sound reproducible and thus variable, all phonographic technologies have the potential to deterritorialize sound and music. <span style="background: aqua;">Maybe the greatest singular moment in nomadic use (= an act of capturing forces, making a new machinic assemblage of existing machinic formations) of phonographic machinery has been the emergence of hip-hop DJ&rsquo;ing and the misuse of vinyl records, making a pair of turntables into a nomadic war machine.</span> For a better part of the last century the record remained inactive, a storage capsule of time.</span></p>
      <p>Apart from few artistic experimentations vinyl records were used as passive playback devices which always referred to some original event captured onto the grooves of the disc. In a parallel to the reinvention of the electric guitar by finding the aesthetic potential of the feedback noise generated by the guitaramplifier -circuit (and thus making electric guitar something other than an amplified replica of acoustic guitar), the DJ would find and learn to use the immanent forces within the record itself.</span></p>
      <p>Radio, a medium which in the early 20</span><sup><span>th</span></sup>&nbsp;Century had a similarly all-pervading role as the internet has today, remained the primary medium of the DJ for a long time. The status of a radio jock rose from that of a salesman/entertainer to a central figure in pop business during the 1950s youth culture explosion. DJ as a sonic artist evolved somewhere else, however: in the&nbsp;<em>discoth&egrave;que</em>, a club for dancing to recorded music instead of a live orchestra. The first discos were born in 1940s France during the German occupation that hampered the live music circuit. After the war some clubs stuck with the concept of dancing to records. This idea migrated elsewhere and in the 50s dance clubs experienced a massive leap in popularity with the advent of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll and youth culture. We can see this as a sort of deterritorialization: <span style="background: lime;">instead of responding to the presence of performers the audience responds to the music and the forces it directs into the space it creates.</span></span></p>
      <p>Disco as a musical style developed from the mantric/tantric heavy funk of James Brown, <span style="background: lime;">followed by others, which concentrated on the bass-heavy, steady and monotonously repetitive groove; a becoming-machine of the rhythm section.</span> This style evolved into even more functionalist direction, downplaying the soul element of funk and delving solely in the groove. Record companies started producing long dance remixes of songs. Disco DJs wanted to create an all-night flow of music and that required a skill of seamlessly mixing records into one another. Any kind of music focusing on rhythm rather than melody could be used; DJ was becoming a curator-figure in the emerging club spaces, such as the loft parties in 1970s New York.</span></p>
      <p>The conceptual leap of DJ from a curator (organizing a collection of works) to an artist (creating a work) happened in 1970s Bronx NY, when local DJs invented the isolating of the breakbeat and hip-hop: they would play only the rhythmic percussion breaks of funk records, alternating the same passage on two turntables, creating their own music. <span style="background: lime;">This rather crude skill of keeping the party going (with the help of an MC hollering encouragements to the party people) soon evolved into finer techniques of vinyl manipulation and collage. </span><span style="background: aqua;">The DJ became a&nbsp;<em>cut chemist.</em></span></span></p>
      <p>Grandmaster Flash&rsquo;s 1981 record&nbsp;<em>The Amazing Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel</em>&nbsp;was almost literally an encyclopedia of DJ techniques: crossfading, punch-phrasing, backspinning, cutting and scratching&hellip; Not only percussion was used as a sound source, almost everything could be dropped into the mix, all kinds of noise, as long as it was on record. In some ways a popularization of&nbsp;<em>musique concr&egrave;te</em>, this meant a huge shift in the perception of music:</span></p>
      <p><span style="background: aqua;">After Flash, the turntable becomes a machine for building and melding mindstates from your record collection. The turntables, a Technics deck, become a subjectivity engine generating a stereophonics, a hifi consciousness of the head, wholly tuned in and turned on by the found noise of vinyl degeneration that hears scratches, crackle, fuzz, hiss and static as lead instruments. (Eshun 14)</span></p>
      <p>The turntable becomes not only a new kind of percussive instrument, it becomes a syntax-destroyer and a connective synthesizer in a Deleuzian sense (mixing this AND this AND this&hellip;). Record is a diagram, a map, rather than a tracing or writing. A map is entirely oriented toward an experimentation in contact with the real&hellip; susceptible to constant modification. (MP 12)</span></p>
      <p>Despite its inventors&rsquo; wishes to provide a surface for the representation of an original event, a stable protector of the preceding mode of organization, the record became a destabilizer, weapon in sonic warfare (a nomadic war machine of sorts). DJ&rsquo;s hand is a&nbsp;<em>terrorwrist</em>&nbsp;&ldquo;opening up a new field of objectile thought: fingertip perception&rdquo; (Eshun 18). <span style="background: aqua;">A deterritorialization of hand and record in the machinic assemblage of scratching.</span></span></p>
      <p><span>The phonographic diagram, given its direct transduction of physical wave to mechanical impulse or electrical signal, provides a code both precisely reproducible and potentially editable. &hellip; [W]here the score represents, phonography simply transduces&hellip; As soon as the deterritorialization of sonic matter into vinyl abstracts it from the moment, and makes music into this random-access memory available time and time again, the sonic matter is susceptible to temporal mutation, warping, looping. (Mackay 250)</span></p>
      <p>DJ&rsquo;s (ab)use of vinyl is a&nbsp;<em>derangement</em>&nbsp;in every sense of the word. Scratching deterritorializes the noise on the grooves, bends the spiral grooves into lines of flight; scratching rips its source material from the record, transforms the ideal into matter to be molded, cuts into syntax to isolate words and phrases, achieving an Artaud-style decoding of language systems (both human and musical). <span style="background: aqua;">A scratch takes up a block of recorded time and folds it up in baroque flourishes like a cloth. Scratching makes audible the flow of time and matter, the flow and the machines that cut it, and creates a vinyl psychedelia =&nbsp;<em>scratchadelia</em>, a machinic refrain, a becoming-vinyl of music.</span></span></p>
      <p>A digital counterpart to the scratch is the often-mentioned glitch. A precariously vague term, which however captures some of the slipperiness of digital media. If analog phonography has led to some sort of metallurgy of sound, made sound malleable and mutable, digital sound processing approaches sound as molecules. The term&nbsp;<em>microsound</em>&nbsp;is very appropriate for the digital music of today. Or, if we take heed of Kim Cascone, we should be talking about post-digital music, since the medium of digital technology has become so transparent it doesn&rsquo;t reflect in the expression of music anymore. Instead specific sound processing tools, such as Max, AudioMulch or SoundForge produce an auratic sound, as well as providing amazing detail and accuracy in manipulating sound.</span></p>
      <p>With glitches, however, electronic music producers embrace the uncertainty John Cage was talking about. Cracked and malfunctioning soft- and hardware, overloaded operating systems, wrong file types opened as sound documents produce unpredictable sounds, sometimes a ghostly unpresence of sounds outside hearing range or gaps in recorded time. Glitches, clicks and cuts are the sound of sound machines molecularizing, atomizing and ionizing sound, making audible the process of sound itself. If we must make a distinction between the scratch and the glitch, it is this: scratching is the folding of recorded time, metallurgy of sound, taking a flow of matter and producing variations of it. Common to music and metallurgy, according to Deleuze and Guattari, is the tendency to &ldquo;bring into its own, beyond separate forms, a continuous development of form, and beyond variable matter, a continuous variation of matter,&rdquo; in short to bring out the &ldquo;life proper to matter.&rdquo; (MP 411)</span></p>
      <p>Glitch, in digital domain, happens on a more abstracted level of decoding that results in molecularized matter. Going beyond the matterform -division (which scratching can be seen starting to evaporate with its variations on matter) the molecularization of sound</span></p>
      <p><span>effects a dissolution of form that connects the most diverse longitudes and latitudes, the most varied speeds and slownesses, which guarantees a continuum by stretching variation far beyond it formal limits. (MP 309)</span></p>
      <p>In both cases, the scratch and the glitch, sound has escaped the overcoding symbolic order of music, or the trancendental plane of organization of the score, in nomadic alliance of man and machines.</span></p>
      <p>James Brown&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Sex Machine</em>&nbsp;and Kraftwerk&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Mensch Maschine</em>define electronic music&rsquo;s identification with machinery with their twin poles of &ldquo;raw&rdquo; physicality and &ldquo;pure&rdquo; spirit/intellect. To dance as mindless robots or to think music as an incorporeal AI. This all-too established dualism has been broken down at times by the music machinery&rsquo;s potential to fuse down the two poles and to break down, to express glitches. Dance music, which might at first thought appear as a musical form most tied up with the reterritorializing function of the refrain, with its strict adherence to certain genre-bound norms, appears however as a machine for liberating sound-in-itself. Rhythm: blocks of sound arranged rhythmically, one after another, one beside another, like the instant pop images of Warhol paintings. Repetition makes the thing repeated (the thing&nbsp;<em>not new</em>&nbsp;anymore) present again. Each repetition (a simulacrum of the &ldquo;original&rdquo;, if any is to be found) is an event in itself;</span></p>
      <p><span>Repetition&nbsp;and&nbsp;first time, but also repetition&nbsp;and&nbsp;last time, since the singularity of any&nbsp;first time&nbsp;makes of it also a&nbsp;last time. Each time it is the event itself, first time is a last time. (Derrida 10)</span></p>
      <p>This repetition, this constant&nbsp;<em>now</em>, can be seen in dance music&rsquo;s lack of drama (or constant crescendo); the changes in music are&nbsp;<em>quantitative</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>qualitative</em>, its narrative is the happening of repetitions. Dance music seeks to build a plateau of intensity. Any vertical, arborescent models are flattened by the rhizomatics of repetition, which undoes the symbolical or critical form of thought. According to Roland Barthes, critique is always either historic or futurologic, its content is culture which equals everything that is inside us,&nbsp;<em>except the present moment</em>&nbsp;(Barthes 32).</span></p>
      <p>Electronic dance music sounds astonishingly non-temporal: repetition makes the track happen in the constant now, concentration on the&nbsp;<em>sound of sound</em>&nbsp;(timbre and &ldquo;color&rdquo; and texture, the most difficult-to-remember-afterwards- and the most deterritorializing aspects of sound and music) fades it from the memory. Repetition is a way of appearing without form, without identity: it multiplies the same element over and over again, juxtaposes the element with its each successive re-emergence, brings out the differences by bringing out the&nbsp;<em>gaps</em>&nbsp;between singular repetitions, forms a machinic assemblage out of the circulation of sound blocks. Musical repetition: loops within loops, clashing against each other,&nbsp;<em>loopduelle</em>. The audibility of these juxtapositions is a textuality of differences and differences mark out the repetitions = returnings = soundghosts.</span></p>
      <p>As the repetition builds up a smooth plane of constant present, deterritorializing the sound itself as a singularity, a sonorous force, there&rsquo;s a tendency for that repetition to become reterritorialized as a clich&eacute;, an all-too expectable formula; this seems to be a potential dead-end for numerous genres of electronic dance music. A glitch appears: a wrinkle in time of the constant present. If we listen to an archetypal glitchy sound, an Oval track for example, we can hear a rich tapestry of sound and absence of sound. There are skips, something is missing, there are holes in the smooth space of sound. Or we can consider Kim Cascone&rsquo;s concept of residualism that involves structuring a work around an absence, removing a signal and leaving only its effects to be heard. Scratching, sampling and the stuttering of malfunctioning soft- and hardware are means of derangement, seeking out a way to make a rhizome out of music, a way to place its elements in continuous variation, where absences, breaks, holes, folds and ruptures can be a part; a way to let ghosts of the outside in.</span></p>

      <p>&ldquo;[M]achines work &hellip; by continually breaking down&hellip;&rdquo; (AO 8), producing anti-production, creating gaps and glitches. One has to remember we?re talking about&nbsp;<em>desiring</em>&nbsp;machines and art&rsquo;s ability to reflect the formative processes of machinic pre-conscious world, which is libidinal. As Jake Mandell observes in his liner notes for his album&nbsp;<em>Love Songs for Machines,</em>&nbsp;artists&rsquo; relation to their tools of the trade has always been fetishistic. A favorite pen of the writer, a beloved brush of the painter; it&rsquo;s always been intimate. Mandell writes that the once-close relationship of artists and their tools has encountered a crisis in the digital age, the screenandmouse -interface is abstract and alienating. Still, as an immersive environment, digital media allow for an exceptionally affectionate experience.</span></p>
      <p>As tool-using creatures (among other such creatures) we&rsquo;ve always been cyborgs. &ldquo;[T]ools exist only in relation to the interminglings they make possible or that make them possible.&rdquo; (MP 90) That is to say, tools imply a symbiosis between two bodies in a machinic assemblage, deterritorializing them both. Think of Roland TB-303 Bassline Generator, becoming an Acid Machine through a glitch, a programming mistake, releasing a whole new spectrum of sounds, transforming both the musician and the instrument. It&rsquo;s a two-way relation: we can well take heed of Kodwo Eshun&rsquo;s conception of human beings as the sex organs of synthesizers. New sounds happen between things, in the movement that sweeps you and your computer to somewhere else: in order to effect deterritorializations you have to love your machines.</span></p>

      <p>by Ryan Hagemann</p>
      <p>November 17, 2016</p> 
      <p>Like many people, I’ve recently become a huge fan of HBO’s <i>Westworld</i>, a new sci-fi series that mashes a lot of <i>Blade Runner</i> with a bit of <i>Jurassic Park</i>. The gist of the story revolves around an amusement park-style operation where customers (the guests) experience a Wild West setting populated by highly advanced robots (the hosts). AI, robotics, and automation are at the core of the series, but one of the central themes also revolves around the nature of “consciousness.” This, I think, is one of the key factors driving confusion about the power of AI in the real world: the distinction (or lack thereof) between “intelligence” and “consciousness.</p>
      <p>Separating out the concerns over an impending SkyNet future is no small task. Popular media has enshrined the bipedal <i>Terminators</i> of James Cameron’s eponymously-titled movies as the inevitable outcome of developments in AI. Many see this as the future this technology will engender. For others, the concerns are simply about the decision trees and algorithmic transparency—that is, if we don’t know how <i>it works</i>, we can’t know how <i>it will fail</i>. Intuition matters in how humans interpret information. For AI, intuition is scarce and even more inscrutable than it is among humans. Since AI is, in the narrowest form, attuned to data sets and not facts about the broader world, it makes extracting general rules about how neural networks and machine learning algorithms operate difficult.</p>
      <p>Yet many fail to realize that every time we use Google’s search, we’re using a very narrow, task-specific form of AI. “As soon as it works,” the famed computer scientist John McCarthy once quipped, “no one calls it AI anymore.” </p>
      <p>The need for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/understanding-artificial-intelligence-decisions/?mbid=social_fb">algorithmic accountability</a> will likely be compounded as this technology becomes more and more a part of everyday life, and everyday decisions. How precisely we achieve that level of transparency and accountability is still unknown, however. At this point in its development, AI is still a “black box.” Until we can <a href="https://medium.com/niskanen-center/why-robot-ad319cb005c#.amgc5fdlj">figure out how to get these systems to “talk” to us</a>—that is, more effectively disclose the rationale behind the outcomes they report—accountability will remain elusive. Nonetheless, we should not let that hurdle blind us to the many benefits this technology will deliver to society.</p>
      <p>As discussed in <a href="https://www.datainnovation.org/2016/10/data-detractors-are-wrong-the-rise-of-algorithms-is-a-cause-for-hope-and-optimism/">a recent report from the Center for Data Innovation</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p><i>Because AI will continue to evolve and work its way into a wide variety of applications, it is difficult to predict just how much value AI will generate. The International Data Corporation estimates that in the United States the market for AI technologies that analyze unstructured data will reach $40 billion by 2020, and will generate more than $60 billion worth of productivity improvements for businesses in the United States per year. Investors in the United States are increasingly recognizing the potential value of AI, investing $757 million in venture capital in AI start-ups in 2013, $2.18 billion in 2014, and $2.39 billion in 2015. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2025 automating knowledge work with AI will generate between $5.2 trillion and $6.77 trillion, advanced robotics relying on AI will generate between $1.7 trillion and $4.5 trillion, and autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles will generate between $0.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion. A report from Accenture examining the potential impact of AI on economic growth found that by 2035, AI could increase the annual growth rate of the U.S. and Finnish economies by 2 percentage points, the Japanese economy by 1.9 points, and the German economy by 1.6 points. The report also found that, for the 12 countries surveyed, AI would boost labor productivity rates by 11 to 37 percent.</i></p></blockquote>
      <p>The economic benefits from this technology are clearly poised to be enormous. Of course, the possibility of an AI-driven economy leads to other, less <i>Terminator</i>-style concerns. More realistic concerns are neither about killer robots or algorithmic transparency, but the issue of an economy of ghosts in the machine. The popular video game series <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> actually touches on this.</p>
      <p>The series revolves around a central cadre of characters fighting a complex web of foes tied together by unseen forces that are slowly revealed to be advanced AIs. Originally constructed to unite the nations of the world, the systems end up becoming the very reasons for which war is waged. Over the course of many decades, these AIs eventually transform the world by inducing a “war economy.” The global economic structure, reengineered by algorithmic optimization, turn conflict into a lucrative business that drives whole state economies to become dependent on never-ending war. By creating everlasting enemies, the AIs are able to accomplish the goals set forth by their progenitors: a world without ideological priors, principles, or ideals, united in a common pursuit of perpetual warfare.</p>
      <p>This might lead us to conclude that the real concern, then, is not so much a future of <i>Terminators</i>, <span style="background-color:lime">but a future of ghosts in the machine, a la <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. Realistically, however, neither situation appears likely for humankind’s near-term future. Nevertheless, policymakers will soon have to confront these issues; and when they do, they should begin with regulatory forbearance, while avoiding doomsaying language. The AIs of science fiction and Hollywood are a far cry from the reality of the day. Fanciful portents of dystopian future make for good clickbait and even better blockbuster hits, but they shouldn’t serve as the basis for informed policies governing developing technologies.</span></p>
      <p><b>Safeguarding Advancements in Artificial Intelligence</b></p>
      <p>Depending on the particular use and application of AI, there are many recommendations to be offered. However, for the time being, the 115th Congress and incoming Administration should embrace regulatory forbearance as the ideal starting point for any future conversation about federal rulemaking. I argued as much in a July comment filing to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on the matter of artificial intelligence (see the full comments <a href="https://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CommentsArtificialIntelligencePolicyOSTP.pdf">here</a>). In those comments, I argued that OSTP and federal regulators should:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Avoid speaking of hyperbolic hypothetical doomsday scenarios; and </li>
      <li>Embrace a policy of regulatory restraint, intervening in the development and use of AI technology only when and if the prospect of harm becomes realistic enough to merit government intervention.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, there are a number of other recommendations worth considering given the policy fissures likely to emerge on perennial issues like privacy and cybersecurity. The following general recommendations should serve as a starting point for regulators and policymakers thinking about this issue:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Any agencies considering regulations specific to AI (though generally applicable to any new emerging technology representing a unique regulatory knowledge gap) need to focus on <i>tangible</i> and <i>known</i> costs and benefits, not hypotheticals;</li>
      <li>Government can be positive contributor to developments in AI by increasing public funding for research into interdisciplinary analyses of the economic and social ramifications of future developments; </li>
      <li>Avoid any singular, mandatory development standards for safety (such as the Food and Drug Administration’s mandatory regime for medical software of “high consequence”); and</li>
      <li>Promote industry self-regulation as a first step towards developing best practices and standards in AI research. This would ideally materialize in the form of independent, third-party validators and open-source developers (such as <a href="https://openai.com/about/">OpenAI</a>) or industry consortiums (such as <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/">The Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society</a>), not as legislative fiat or prescriptive mandates imposed by regulators or other government actors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short, the best policy recommendations for promoting innovation in AI will rely on flexible regulatory frameworks. Government can be a valuable ally in helping to accelerate the development and deployment of this technology, but it should not stand as a gatekeeper to the future. As noted in <a href="https://ai100.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ai_100_report_0831fnl.pdf">the first report from Stanford University’s <i>One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence</i></a>, initiative, policies can and should “strengthen a virtuous cycle of activity involving internal and external accountability, transparency, and professionalization, rather than narrow compliance.” Additionally, any policy developments should be continually reevaluated as new challenges emerge. A one-size-fits-all ex ante methodology of precautionary regulation simply will neither foster this industry’s development or maximize beneficial outcomes for society.</p>
      <p><b>Accelerating the Autonomous Roadway</b></p>
      <p>Perhaps the most pressing application of AI—and one of the leading technological applications driving public fears of this field—is already unfolding around us. Driverless cars are already hitting the roads, from Pittsburgh to the streets of Mountain View, and even around the world. The United States, if it wishes to maintain its lead in this emerging space, as well as reap the benefits from ongoing innovations, needs to create an environment of regulatory certainty. In upcoming comments to the National Highways Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on its Federal Autonomous Vehicle Policy Guidelines, I argue against some of the guidelines’ newly proposed authorities and expanded interpretation of existing authorities. </p>
      <p>NHTSA itself notes that: “Substitution of pre-market approval for all standards for which manufacturers currently self-certify would be a wholesale structural change in the way NHTSA regulates motor vehicle safety and would require both fundamental statutory changes and a large increase in Agency resources.” This is problematic. While it is understandable that the agency would argue for structural changes to assist in their efforts to address concerns from a new technology like this, it is unclear that a “large increase in Agency resources” would yield more optimal outcomes. Alternatively, this is an area where the 115th Congress can potentially lead, reasserting its legislative authority to address the issue of autonomous vehicles and federally preempt any disconcerting legislation coming from states and localities.</p>
      <p>Promoting an expeditious and effective deployment of this technology is important in order to actualize the social and economic benefits associated with autonomous vehicles, to say nothing of the tens of thousands of lives that could be saved.</p>
      <p><b>Why the Time For Action is Now</b></p>
      <p>Autonomous vehicles are but one case study in how advancements in AI have helped usher in a new era of technological progress. As AI is incorporated into developments in headline-grabbing technologies, public attention is naturally becoming more focused on developments in this space. We all walk around with task-specific AI in our phones (Siri, Cortana, etc.) and utilize virtual private assistants, voice recognition technology, Google Translate, and a host of other AI-driven technological conveniences. It’s important, now more than ever, that legislators and Administration officials take the lead in continuing to examine developments in this technology, while foregoing ex ante regulatory measures. As AI continues to drive developments in other technologies, the potential for bad regulatory action could stymie not only autonomous vehicles, but numerous other technologies—some not yet even imagined—that could hold the potential to improve the lives of millions of Americans. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Through 2017 and Beyond</b></p>
      <p><div class="marked">Philosophers’ dilemmas and apocalyptic rhetoric should not be mistaken for the real world dilemmas facing policymakers. The reality is that AI does not present a fundamental existential challenge to human existence, and likely will not for many, many decades to come. When it comes to AI research, let a thousand strategies bloom. For legislators and regulators, however, let but one strategy be the guiding light: embrace forbearance and let the private sector lead.</div></p>
      <p>Stay tuned the week after next&nbsp;for the third issue policymakers need to focus on in 2017: the Internet of Things.</p>

      <p>by Taina Bucher</p>
      <p><strong>Upcoming</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="http://gli.tc/h">Gli.tc/h</a>&nbsp;noise &amp; new media festival, September 28 thru October 3, 2010. The international conference and gathering will take place in Chicago to celebrate the aesthetics of the glitch.</p>
      <p>A glitch is a short-lived digital or analog error. Such errors mostly occur when there is some sort of mistranslation in the transmission of data between different domains in a computational system. A visual glitch is not the error itself, but its visual manifestation of it. They appear as a malfunction (a voltage-change or signal of the wrong duration) in an electrical circuit. In software a glitch is something unpredictable, something that changes the desired or expected output of the system. Things go wrong. I think Olga Goriunova and Alexei Shulgin describe what a glitch is all about in a nice way in their contribution to the&nbsp;<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476">Software Studies lexicon</a>: &ldquo;A glitch is a mess that is a moment, a possibility to glance at software&rsquo;s inner structure&hellip;it shows the ghostly conventionality of the forms by which digital spaces are organized&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>The unexpected and the dysfunctional nature of the glitch lend itself well for artistic explorations. Glitch aesthetics is the visualization or making visible of errors, it is a way of organizing perception that emphasizes the artificiality of representation. The aesthetics of glitch makes the functionality and dysfunctionality of software appear. It interrupts the event and breaks down the expected.</p>
      <p>Glitch art is an art form that plays with these manifestations of errors, these ruptures and cracks. According to artist&nbsp;<a href="http://rosa-menkman.blogspot.com/search/label/GlitchStudiesManifesto">Rosa Menkman</a>, glich art shows how destruction can change into the creation of something original. Glitch art is not just about errors produced deliberatively by the artists but also about a way of expression that depends on multiple actors contributing to the creation of unexpected events in computational systems. Menkman describes her artistic practice in producing glitch art as uncanny and sublime. &ldquo;The artist tries to catch something that is the result of an uncertain balance, a shifting, un-catchable, unrealized utopia connected to randomness and idyllic disintegrations&rdquo;. She says: &ldquo;I manipulate, bend and break any medium towards the point where it becomes something new&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>The artist&nbsp;<a href="http://nickbriz.com/">Nick Briz</a>&nbsp;compares glitch art to cubism. The logic of cubism he says is that of reducing natural forms into its basic geometric constituencies, glitch art does something similar by attempting to expose the algorithmic processes into an aesthetic form. Glitch art also resembles pop art in his view. Like pop art, glitch art shows an interest in popular culture by appropriating it. What&rsquo;s being appropriated are the errors occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio and other forms of data. Unlike Menkman, Briz seems to think that artists primarily search the digital landscape in order to catch, grab and record a glitch, rather than intentionally create them.</p>
      <p>The question is whether a glitch is still a glitch, that is an unexpected result of a malfunction, if it is intentionally created? Is it possible to make a mistake on purpose and still call it a mistake?</p>
      <p>One of the most prominent glitch theorists,&nbsp;<a href="http://oculasm.org/glitch">Iman Moradi</a>, distinguishes in his&nbsp;<a href="http://oculasm.org/glitch/download/Glitch_dissertation_print.pdf">dissertation</a>&nbsp;between the &ldquo;pure glitch&rdquo; of the unexpected malfunction and the &ldquo;glitch-alike&rdquo; which is a result of an intentional human decision. Moradi together with Ant Scott, Joe Gilmore and Chrisopher Murphy just last year published one of the first&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glitch-Designing-Imperfection-Iman-Moradi/dp/0979966663">books</a>&nbsp;(if not the first) solely devoted to glitch aesthetics &ndash; to the art of loss of information, the frozen uncertainty, and the revenge of the machine.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/the-ghost-in-the-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ghost in the Machine</a></h2>
      <p>By Josephine Wolff <br>May 6, 2015 9:30 am</p>
      <p>The month after my grandmother died, I received several emails from her. Not from her, of course, but from an old AOL email account of hers that had been taken over by spammers. My mother and other family members called to ask me &mdash; the granddaughter who studies computer security &mdash; to make the emails stop. We were all strangely unsettled by these messages from beyond the grave, by my grandmother&rsquo;s sudden appearance in our inboxes so soon after we&rsquo;d lost her. More than just spam, this felt like a ghost in the machine.</p>
      <p>To my grandmother, born in 1927, everything about computers and the Internet had seemed slightly supernatural. A writer for more than 60 years, she understood that being a professional in this day and age &mdash; selling books and articles, communicating with publishers and agents, editing and revising &mdash; required using a computer. And so she did.</p>
      <p>But she regarded machines with suspicion and mistrust. Above all, she felt a deep sense of despair that something cataclysmic and irreparable had happened whenever she couldn&rsquo;t find the Firefox icon (which she referred to as Foxfire), or open an email attachment. She would call me and say woefully: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent all day looking for the story I was writing and it&rsquo;s completely disappeared. I don&rsquo;t know what I did. I&rsquo;ve broken the Internet.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>How ironic that she should have an afterlife on that same Internet she was so sure she had broken. Nowadays, online ghosts and Internet afterlives are not just for those with big digital footprints and major social media lives but even for my grandmother, who considered it a major achievement to find the send button in her email. And if she thought the Internet was magic &mdash; good magic or malevolent magic &mdash; perhaps it&rsquo;s also oddly fitting that it should be some 21st-century version of beyond the veil, our gateway to the spirit world.</p>
      <p>Magical or not, my grandmother struggled mightily with the computer. It got harder as her eyesight deteriorated and she was both increasingly unable to navigate the screen and increasingly prone to frustration. Na&iuml;ve digital native that I am, I periodically believed I could fix her problems with a well-placed technological intervention.</p>
      <p>In 2010, I set up a&nbsp;<a href="https://blogginggrandma.com/">blog</a>&nbsp;for her (tagline: &ldquo;Five years older than the A train&rdquo;) so she could continue writing for an audience even as it got harder for her to navigate the world of professional publishing. In the summer of 2012, I persuaded her to buy an enormous 27-inch iMac and set it up in her apartment, magnifying the cursor and the text and the icons so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to strain her eyes. I created an iChat account that would launch automatically and set it so that I could take control of her desktop remotely, using my own account, whenever something went wrong.</p>
      <p>On some level, I understood even then that there was no technology that could make up for going blind, nothing that would make that loss less acute or painful or resented &mdash; but I put everything I could think of into that computer, making it so big and simple and user-friendly that maybe, just maybe, while writing on its enormous screen, in type magnified by 400 percent, she would forget that she could no longer read a newspaper or easily navigate the city where she had lived almost her entire life.</p>
      <p>There were still lots of despairing phone calls, only now I could hang up the phone and connect directly to her computer from my own laptop, 200 miles away, talking to her and moving her mouse from afar, telling her, when she asked, bewildered, where my voice was coming from, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;m in the computer.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>And then, suddenly, she was the one in my computer &mdash; and not just because of the creepy emails that arrived so soon after her death. In the year since my grandmother died, I have inherited some items she loved &mdash; jewelry, clothing, books, refrigerator magnets in the shape of Popsicles &mdash; and also, inevitably, that computer, which now lives on my desk in Cambridge, with her usernames and passwords still scrawled in her shaky, oversize handwriting on scraps of paper taped to the screen, with the font and icons still magnified, and the blog post she was only 200 words into when she went to the hospital still saved on the desktop.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m sometimes startled by how powerfully that computer evokes my grandmother for me. As a break from my own work, I often clean out her inbox or go through her documents &mdash; that most intimate of after-death invasions &mdash; and read her words: letters, blog posts, essays, short stories, a novel, bad puns, revision upon revision, endless accidentally created automatic backups and copies. I can almost hear her voice (as she so often heard mine) coming out of the screen, can almost see her painstakingly pecking at her oversize keyboard to correct the typos or finish the latest blog post, can almost appreciate what a mystical machine it must have seemed to her.</p>
      <p>These days, I use the computer mostly to work on my dissertation, which is about how we defend computers against attacks and about the complex interplay and interactions between the kinds of defenses we use (encryption, firewalls, passwords) and the types of defenders involved (organizations, policy makers, software developers). It focuses on the ways we often end up defending computer systems against the wrong things. We mean to protect against theft or fraud but ultimately only manage to protect against short passwords or open ports &mdash; which often turn out to be weak proxies for the real dangers.</p>
      <p>I discuss the misleading rhetoric in which we talk about attackers &ldquo;getting into&rdquo; computers, when in fact, attacks consist of a series of escalating access capabilities. There is no moment at which an attacker is suddenly &ldquo;in&rdquo; a compromised computer.</p>
      <p>I make this argument now on that very same machine from which I regularly announced to my grandmother, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the computer,&rdquo; the same machine that I tried so unsuccessfully to layer with as many defenses as I could against her worsening eyesight and technological despair, the same machine that has slips of paper with her passwords written on them taped to the bottom of the screen because, poor security practice or no, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to throw them away.</p>
      <p>It is at once funny and strange and sad and fitting to write on my grandmother&rsquo;s computer. There&rsquo;s undeniable comedy in the idea that anything of hers should even touch a computer-science dissertation. And, of course, it&rsquo;s bittersweet, still, to look at her handwritten notes below the screen and her archives of years&rsquo; worth of writing and realize all over again, I&rsquo;m never going to get another call that she&rsquo;s broken the Internet, never going to find her Foxfire icon, never going to be inside her computer, never going to talk to her again.</p>
      <p>But the right way to remember my grandmother is to write, so I go back to my dissertation, and I try to channel her dedication, her passion for writing, if not her belief that the machines were out to get her, into my thesis &mdash; she would not have understood a single word, I know, and yet her voice is on every page.</p>

    <p>Glitch art compared to punk, reaction to hyperrealism and perfection. Happy accidents (data corruption) or simulated processes are very important. “Improvisationally react to what’s going on”, sensibility of fleetingness</p>
