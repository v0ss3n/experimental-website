  <p>My collection is about hacktivism: electronic protest for social change which combines programming skills with critical thinking.<br><br>
Hacktivists fight for freedom and privacy online. It is a collective of individuals mostly coming together on the deep web. These hackers are online and invisible, or offline and hidden behind anonymous masks. People from groups like Anonymous call themselves part of an ideological army.<br><br>
But who are these people? They pride themselves in being unknown, only known by aliases, a name on a computer screen or a man without a face. This lack of identity interested me, as it gave me the opportunity to imagine it myself. <br><br>
With my collection I imagine what a hacktivist army might look like. With finding out my designing method I started where a hacker would start: on a computer. I translated various cyber-attacks to ways to create new forms related to the body. I found programs that fit my concept, as they helped me simulate attacks like DDoS and brute force attacks. I determined the input and the program gave me the output. By repeating this process over and over again I made digital moulages.  This way the computer worked for me. After all: that is the weapon of the hacktivist. <br><br>
In addition to that I wanted to give the clothing more character by using some of the hackers’ humor: trolling. This is visible in details where the clothes seem to have eyes and a mouth, and in strange, animal-like buttons and patches. The end result is a sequence of looks gradually becoming more disrupted and ‘hacked’. <br><br>
The time has come for us to unite, the time has come for us to stand up and fight! You are Anonymous!
We are in the information era.
We are Anonymous,
We are Legion,
We do not forget,
We do not forgive,
Expect us.
