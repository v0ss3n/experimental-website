            <h4>cyborg / man-machine</h4>
            <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">(from:
                wikipedia)</a>
              A cyborg (short for "cybernetic organism") is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts.
              The
              term was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.
              The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic, biorobot or android; it applies to an organism that has
              restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology
              that relies on some sort of feedback. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, including humans,
              they might also conceivably be any kind of organism.
              D. S. Halacy's Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new
              frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to
              'outer
              space' – a bridge...between mind and matter."
              In popular culture, some cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g., Cyborg from DC Comics,
              the
              Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek or Darth Vader from Star Wars) or as
              almost
              indistinguishable from humans (e.g., the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica,
              etc.).
              Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when
              used
              for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with
              physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons,
              among other things), such as Robocop.

              animal-human and machine, and physical and non-physical. Evolution has blurred the lines between human
              and
              animal; 20th Century machines have made ambiguous the lines between natural and artificial; and
              microelectronics and the political invisibility of cyborgs have confused the lines of physicality.

              question
              “Would you live with an autonomous prosthesis?” Using speculative methods and critical conversations, we
              discuss the ethics of AI in relation to future intelligent machines that do not only live with us, but on
              and
              within us. What forms of bodily experience will emerge? Who will own the algorithms and the data driving
              these new prosthesis? Will prosthetic devices become more appealing to those who do not necessarily need
              one?
              Will they become more useful for those in real need?</p>

            <h4>ghost in the machine</h4>
            <p>Fascination for the ghost in the machine started with <a href="the-chaos-machine.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">the
                Chaos machine.</a> Can machines have personalities? Can they be artists? </p>
            <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://grammarist.com/idiom/ghost-in-the-machine/">(from:
                grammarist)</a>
              The ghost in the machine means the consciousness or mind carried in a physical entity. Gilbert Ryle
              coined
              the term in his 1949 work The Concept of Mind as a criticism of René Descartes. Descartes believed in
              dualism, the idea that the human mind is not physical, that it exists independently of the human brain.
              Ryle
              referred to this idea as the ghost in the machine. He believed that human consciousness and mind are very
              dependent on the human brain. The term ghost in the machine has come to also describe the supposed
              consciousness in a device that behaves as if it has a will that is independent of what the human operator
              wants the device to do. Computer programmers have appropriated the term ghost in the machine to explain
              when
              a programs runs contrary to their expectations. The idiom ghost in the machine is a metaphor, which is a
              comparison that is made figuratively.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Author Stephen King used the concept of the ghost in the machine to refer to his character Blaine the
                Mono,
                the train with a split mind that runs the town of Lud in his 1991 novel The Dark Tower III: The Waste
                Lands
                from his series The Dark Tower.

                The Japanese manga and anime Ghost in the Shell takes place in a future where computer technology has
                evolved to be able to interface with the human brain making artificial intelligence and cyber-brains
                indistinguishable from organic brains. The main character, Major Motoko Kusanagi has a body that is
                completely cybernetic, her brain being the only part of her that is still human. The manga's creator
                Masamune Shirow adapted the title from the 1967 Arthur Koestler book The Ghost in the Machine.

                A Season 3 episode of The Transformers (TV series) (1986) is titled Ghost In The Machine, where the
                ghost
                of Starscream possesses Scourge, Astrotrain, and Trypticon in a scheme to get Unicron to recreate his
                body.
                In this case it's a literal ghost in literal machines (robots).

              <li>
                Dr. Alfred Lanning, a central character of I, Robot (film), uses the phrase "ghosts in the machine" to
                refer to the process of artificial intelligence unexpectedly evolving past its original intended
                purpose.

                rel="noopener noreferrer">(from: tainabucher.com)</a>A glitch is a short-lived digital or analog error.
              Such errors mostly occur when there is some sort of mistranslation in the transmission of data between
              different domains in a computational system. A visual glitch is not the error itself, but its visual
              manifestation of it. They appear as a malfunction (a voltage-change or signal of the wrong duration) in
              an
              electrical circuit. In software a glitch is something unpredictable, something that changes the desired
              or
              expected output of the system. Things go wrong. I think Olga Goriunova and Alexei Shulgin describe what a
              glitch is all about in a nice way in their contribution to the Software Studies lexicon: “A glitch is a
              mess
              that is a moment, a possibility to glance at software’s inner structure…it shows the ghostly
              conventionality
              of the forms by which digital spaces are organized”. </p>
            <p><a href="https://thevaultpublication.com/2015/01/20/a-philosophical-analysis-of-ghost-in-the-shell-1995/">(from:
                thevaultpublication.com)</a>
              In this film, a soul is referred to as a “ghost” and the plot is propelled forward by a myth concerning
              an
              entirely robotic being containing its own “ghost”. This ultimately brings forth questions as to what a
              “ghost” is and whether artificial lifeforms can possess these “ghosts”. Similarly, it also pushes forward
              the
              question of what is inherently unique to humans if robotic beings can mimic something such as a “ghost”.
              It
              is immediately apparent that this film presents the idea of dualism; the mind and body are presented as
              different entities.</p>

                <p>People hear about Friendly AI and say - this is one of the top three initial reactions:</p>
                <p>"Oh, you can try to tell the AI to be Friendly, but if the AI can modify its own source code, it'll
                  just
                  remove any constraints you try to place on it."</p>
                <p>And where does&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;decision come from?</p>
                <p>Does it enter from outside causality, rather than being an effect of a lawful chain of causes which
                  started with the source code as originally written?&nbsp; Is the AI the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/rc/the_ultimate_source/">Author*
                    source</a>&nbsp;of its own free will?</p>
                <p>A Friendly AI is not a selfish AI constrained by a special extra conscience module that overrides
                  the AI's
                  natural impulses and tells it what to do.&nbsp; You just build the conscience, and that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the
                  AI.&nbsp; If you have a program that computes which decision the AI should make, you're&nbsp;<em>done</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a

                <p>At this point, I shall take a moment to quote some case studies from the Computer Stupidities site
                  and
                  Programming subtopic.&nbsp; (I am not linking to this, because it is a fearsome time-trap; you can
                  Google
                  if you dare.)</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <hr />
                  <p>I tutored college students who were taking a computer programming course. A few of them didn't
                    understand that computers are not sentient.&nbsp; More than one person used comments in their
                    Pascal
                    programs to put detailed explanations such as, "Now I need you to put these letters on the
                    screen."&nbsp;
                    I asked one of them what the deal was with those comments. The reply:&nbsp; "How else is the
                    computer
                    going to understand what I want it to do?"&nbsp; Apparently they would assume that since they
                    couldn't
                    make sense of Pascal, neither could the computer.</p>
                  <hr />
                  <p>While in college, I used to tutor in the school's math lab.&nbsp; A student came in because his
                    BASIC
                    program would not run. He was taking a beginner course, and his assignment was to write a program
                    that
                    would calculate the recipe for oatmeal cookies, depending upon the number of people you're baking
                    for.&nbsp; I looked at his program, and it went something like this:</p>
                  <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Preheat oven to 350<br />20&nbsp; &nbsp;Combine all ingredients in a large mixing
                    bowl<br />30&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;Mix until smooth</p>
                  <hr />
                  <p>An introductory programming student once asked me to look at his program and figure out why it was
                    always churning out zeroes as the result of a simple computation.&nbsp; I looked at the program,
                    and it
                    was pretty obvious:</p>
                  <p class="excerpt">begin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; read("Number of Apples", apples)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
                    read("Number of Carrots", carrots)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; read("Price for 1 Apple", a_price)<br />&nbsp;
                    &nbsp; read("Price for 1 Carrot", c_price)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; write("Total for Apples", a_total)<br />&nbsp;
                    &nbsp; write("Total for Carrots", c_total)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; write("Total", total)<br />&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    total = a_total + c_total<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a_total = apples * a_price<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c_total
                    =
                    carrots * c_price<br />end</p>
                  <p><span class="speaker">Me:</span>&nbsp;"Well, your program can't print correct results before
                    they're
                    computed."<br /><span class="speaker">Him:</span>&nbsp;"Huh?&nbsp; It's logical what the right
                    solution
                    is, and the computer should reorder the instructions the right way."</p>
                  <hr />
                </blockquote>
                <p>There's an instinctive way of imagining the scenario of "programming an AI".&nbsp; It maps onto a
                  similar-seeming human endeavor:&nbsp; Telling a human being what to do.&nbsp; Like the "program" is
                  giving
                  instructions to a little ghost that sits inside the machine, which will look over your instructions
                  and
                  decide whether it likes them or not.</p>
                <p>There is no ghost who looks over the instructions and decides how to follow them.&nbsp; The
                  program&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the
                  AI.</p>
                <p>That doesn't mean the ghost does anything you wish for, like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/">genie</a>.&nbsp;
                  It doesn't mean the ghost does everything you want the way you want it, like a slave of exceeding
                  docility.&nbsp; It means your instruction&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the only ghost that's there, at least
                  at
                  boot time.</p>
                <p>AI is much harder than people instinctively imagined, exactly because you can't just&nbsp;<em>tell&nbsp;</em>the
                  ghost what to do.&nbsp; You have to build the ghost from scratch, and everything that seems obvious
                  to you,
                  the ghost will not see unless you know how to make the ghost see it.&nbsp; You can't just&nbsp;<em>tell</em>&nbsp;the
                  ghost to see it. &nbsp;You have to create that-which-sees from scratch.</p>
                <p>If you don't know how to build something that seems to have some strange ineffable elements like,
                  say,
                  "decision-making", then you can't just shrug your shoulders and let the ghost's free will do the job.
                  You're left forlorn and ghostless.</p>
                <p>There's more to building a chess-playing program than building a really fast processor - so the AI
                  will be
                  really smart - and then typing at the command prompt "Make whatever chess moves&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;think
                  are best."&nbsp; You might think that, since the programmers themselves are not very good
                  chess-players,
                  any advice they tried to give the electronic superbrain would just slow the ghost down.&nbsp; But
                  there is
                  no ghost.&nbsp; You see the problem.</p>
                <p>And there isn't a simple spell you can perform to - poof! - summon a complete ghost into the
                  machine.&nbsp; You can't say, "I summoned the ghost, and it appeared; that's cause and effect for
                  you."&nbsp; (It doesn't work if you use the notion of "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iv/the_futility_of_emergence/">emergence</a>"
                  or "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ix/say_not_complexity/">complexity</a>" as a substitute for
                  "summon", either.)&nbsp; You can't give an instruction to the CPU, "Be a good chessplayer!"&nbsp; You
                  have
                  to see inside the mystery of chess-playing thoughts, and structure the whole ghost from scratch.</p>
                <p>No matter how common-sensical, no matter how logical, no matter how "obvious" or "right" or
                  "self-evident"
                  or "intelligent" something seems to you, it will not happen inside the ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Unless</em>&nbsp;it
                  happens at the end of a chain of cause and effect that began with the instructions that&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;had
                  to decide on, plus any causal dependencies on sensory data that you built into the starting
                  instructions.</p>
                <p>This doesn't mean you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/l9/artificial_addition/">program in
                    every
                    decision explicitly</a>. Deep Blue was a far superior chessplayer than its programmers.&nbsp; Deep
                  Blue
                  made better chess moves than anything its makers could have explicitly programmed - but not because
                  the
                  programmers shrugged and left it up to the ghost.&nbsp; Deep Blue moved better than its
                  programmers... at
                  the end of a chain of cause and effect that began in the programmers' code and proceeded lawfully
                  from
                  there.&nbsp; Nothing happened&nbsp;<em>just</em>because it was so obviously a good move that Deep
                  Blue's
                  ghostly free will took over, without the code and its lawful consequences being involved.</p>
                <p>If you try to wash your hands of constraining the AI, you aren't left with a free ghost like an
                  emancipated slave.&nbsp; You are left with a heap of sand that no one has purified into silicon,
                  shaped
                  into a CPU and programmed to think.</p>
                <p><span class="marked">Go ahead, try telling a computer chip "Do whatever you want!"&nbsp; See what
                    happens?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Because you haven't constrained it to understand freedom.</span></p>
                <p>All it takes is one single step that is&nbsp;<em>so obvious, so logical, so self-evident</em>&nbsp;that
                  your mind just skips right over it, and you've left the path of the AI programmer.&nbsp; It takes an
                  effort
                  like the one I showed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/re/grasping_slippery_things/">Grasping
                    Slippery Things</a>&nbsp;to prevent your mind from doing this.</p>

                <p>Ghosts</p>
                <p><span style="background: aqua;">In science fiction, ghosts in machines always appear as
                    malfunctions,
                    glitches, interruptions in the normal flow of things. Something unexpected appears seemingly out of
                    nothing and from nowhere. Through a malfunction, a glitch, we get a fleeting glimpse of an alien
                    intelligence at work. As electricity has become the basic element of the world we live in, the
                    steady hum
                    of power grids and their flowing immaterial essences slowly replacing the cogs and cranks of
                    everyday
                    machinery</span>, the ghostly rapport has also relocated into the domain of current fluctuations,
                  radio
                  interference and misread data.</p>
                <p>Early telegraph experimenters heard strange raps and clicks issuing from disturbances in
                  Earth&rsquo;s
                  magnetic field, seemingly communication from some other side; Thomas Edison tried to put together a
                  radio
                  device to address denizens of other worlds; Constantin Raudive, Raymond Cass and Friedrich
                  J&cedil;rgenson
                  spent hours and hours attempting to capture voices of the dead onto magnetic tape; radio antennas at
                  Arecibo Observatory are pointed skywards, waiting for extraterrestrial signals. The presence of some
                  outside force has always been supposed to be apparent through interference and interruption.</span></p>
                <p>Actual facts about these manifestations are not really important. The interesting thing is that
                  every new
                  medium seems to open up a new kind of outside, every new mode of perception leaving out, or even
                  creating,
                  something imperceptible, and on the other hand bringing out something previously out of reach. Erik
                  Davis
                  has named the outside boundary of electronic media as the <span style="background: aqua;">&ldquo;electromagnetic
                    imaginary,&rdquo; meaning that many animistic or alchemistic notions of essential energies and life
                    spirits have been translated into the concept of electricity, and remaining in the
                    &ldquo;technological
                    unconscious.&rdquo; Machines seem to be inhabiting some kind of life, even as it is an extension of
                    ourselves.</span> The sheer uncanniness of a <span style="background: lime;">disembodied voice
                    transmitting via telephone line</span>, as experienced by early telephone users, is quite hard to
                  imagine
                  now, but think of hearing a voice of a recently departed person on an answering machine.</span></p>
                <p>We can remember Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s words about electronic media having outered the central
                  nervous
                  system itself, thus making the world into a smooth plateau of perception. This rings true when
                  considering
                  digital media, which is characterized by its transparency, its smoothness. <span style="background: aqua;">Any
                    type of information is de- and recodable into another format. This kind of flux and mutability of
                    digital
                    media makes it into an immersive enviroment, rather like sound.</span></span></p>
                <p>So far, however, our conception of electronic media seems to have been very visually dominated and
                  tied up
                  to the more general link between the visual and the rational, which has been prominent in Western
                  thought.
                  However, many thinkers have also&nbsp;<em>heard </em>something new coming from the explosion of new
                  media
                  since the 19</span><sup><span>th</span></sup>&nbsp;Century. McLuhan wrote about the acoustic quality
                  of the
                  electronic global village he saw coming. German philosopher Wolfgang Welsch, in his essay &ldquo;On
                  the Way
                  to an Auditive Culture?&rdquo; addresses the problem of oculacentrism of the Western philosophical
                  tradition and tries to create a conception of an auditive form of thinking. How to think of sound
                  itself
                  when the epistemological focus of our thinking and our concepts is located in a seeing subject? With
                  its
                  temporality and immersiveness, sound seems to avoid clarity, categorization and objectivity. <span
                    style="background: lime;">Light
                    and sight reveal objects, sound is the result of processes, of something happening and of mistakes:
                    there
                    can&rsquo;t be glitches without processes. The whole notion of glitch is tied up to an
                    &ldquo;auditive&rdquo; thoughtform, which approaches the world as a multiplicity of processes
                    rather than
                    a pre-set field of objects.</span></span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>The scratches and glitches of contemporary electronic music, its aesthetics of interruption and
                  misuse,
                  should be considered in relation to the ontology of the Outside, or its&nbsp;<em>hauntology</em>&nbsp;(to
                  quote Derrida writing about hauntings and returnings). Contemporary thought has painstakingly strived
                  to
                  approach this outside of thought and perception. The subject and the world, if such separation can be
                  made,
                  are seen to be formed in complex interrations between both. The subject emerges from the processes of
                  the
                  world. Deleuze and Guattari give these processes a name: machines. <span style="background: aqua;">Machines
                    are defined as &ldquo;a&nbsp;<em>system of interruptions</em>&nbsp;or breaks&rdquo; (AO 36),
                    cutting and
                    redirecting the energetic flows of preconscious world, which can be thought of as an infinitely
                    complex
                    assemblage of machines acting upon other machines acting upon others etc.</span> A subjectivity is
                  emergent and residual, having only a limited perspective upon the underlying world of forces it
                  inhabits.
                  Looking at our surroundings we&nbsp;<em>recognize</em>&nbsp;things, we are creatures of habit and
                  conventions. Thinking, ultimately a creative act, is not recognition but an encounter, violence to
                  thought.
                  Something comes from the outside that interrupts and grabs us and forces us outside of our habitual
                  territory.</span></p>
                <p>By introducing the&nbsp;<em>refrain</em>&nbsp;Deleuze and Guattari have created a concept that
                  illustrates
                  the constantly shifting nature of relations between territorialized or habitual milieu and the chaos
                  of the
                  outside forces. A refrain, in the domain of music, can be described very vaguely as a rhythmic
                  element,
                  something marking out a territory amidst chaos: a nursery rhyme, a child&rsquo;s song to comfort
                  oneself, a
                  birdsong to stake out a territory? Refrain doesn&rsquo;t, however, have just a reactionary function
                  against
                  chaos; it is situated in the middle and has a potential to both reterritorialize and deterritorialize
                  sound, constantly on the border of a territory. Art has posited itself onto this border. Or, <span
                    style="background: aqua;">to
                    paraphrase Deleuze and Guattari, all creative activity, whether it&rsquo;s art, philosophy or
                    science,
                    has to approach the outside of thought. To be able to create new ways to feel the world, new
                    percepts and
                    affects, one has to court the chaos and worship the glitch.</span></span></p>
                <p><strong><span>Machines</span></strong></p>
                <p>Contemporary electronic music has approached this outside of thought, or outside of music, by
                  distancing
                  itself from the hierarchy of Western classical music tradition, which has valuated certain musical
                  structures (such as melody/harmony) over another qualities (rhythm, timbre) and posited the score as
                  a
                  transcendent compositional principle. Deleuze and Guattari observe the deterritorializing tendency of
                  refrain in music:</span></p>
                <p><span>Certain modern musicians oppose the transcendental plan(e) of organization, which is said to
                    have
                    dominated all of Western classical music, to the immanent sound plane, which is always given along
                    with
                    that to which it gives rise, brings the imperceptible to perception, and carries only differential
                    speeds
                    and slownesses in a kind of molecular lapping:&nbsp;the work of art must mark seconds, tenths and
                    hundredths of seconds. (MP 267)</span></p>
                <p>If art&rsquo;s quest is to bring the imperceptible to perception, music seeks to make audible the
                  inaudible forces of time and duration, to bring out an immanent sound plane, a pure sound block, in
                  which
                  &ldquo;forms are replaced by pure modifications of speed.&rdquo; (MP 267) How does one manage to get
                  away
                  from the grip of musical forms while being still able to retain a plane of consistency; to not
                  regress into
                  undifferentiated chaos which couldn&rsquo;t hold any consistency? This is the question of the
                  refrain.</span></p>
                <p>In order to become-other, one has to align with some outerior forces and create new machinic
                  assemblages.
                  That&rsquo;s why Deleuze and Guattari write that refrain isn&rsquo;t the origin of music but rather a
                  means
                  of preventing it, warding it off (MP 300). Becoming is an alliance. With music machines we have
                  entered a
                  new kind of musical alliance. Phonography, the art of recording sound, allows the production of a
                  smooth
                  sound plane, on which all relations between its various elements are immanent as recording extracts
                  or
                  constructs a block of time, a musical time that is present as sound penetrates our bodies, but
                  emerges as a
                  result from an (quasi)event which is distant from us spatially and temporarily.</span></p>
                <p>One can see the effect of recording or sound processing technology as having helped in breaking with
                  the
                  traditional musical notation and the ideal of a pure musical form. <span style="background: lime;">Once
                    all
                    sound has become recordable and reproducible by machines, we can be done away with the concept of
                    music
                    as residing, ultimately, in the score.</span> Phonography and electronic/digital media have
                  flattened out
                  the arborescent model of the actual sound&rsquo;s relation to a higher structure, that is, the
                  composition
                  itself as actualized in various levels of perfection in the performances of musicians. From machinic
                  point
                  of view (or hearing) there&rsquo;s no difference between voice and noise, we have only sonic stratum
                  and
                  various means to manipulate that sound matter.</span></p>
                <p>The concept of frequency, according to German media philosopher Friedrich Kittler, brought about by
                  recording technology, allows music to break with the Old European tradition of pythagorean harmony
                  and
                  notation as the preserver of clear and pure sounds (in opposition to the chaotic noise of the world).
                  Since
                  the 19</span><sup><span>th</span></sup>&nbsp;Century sound has been recordable, vibrations in a
                  carrying
                  medium transferable to a recording surface. <span style="background: lime;">&ldquo;The phonograph
                    does not
                    hear as our ears that have been trained immediately to filter voices, words and sounds out of
                    noise; it
                    registers acoustic events as such.&rdquo;</span> (Kittler 23) The phonograph hears sounds <span
                    style="background: lime;">acousmatically,
                    without a relation to the origin of a sound.</span></span></p>
                <p>Using the concepts of Deleuze and Guattari, we can state that the phonograph deterritorializes
                  sound,
                  flattens down the hierarchical organization of music into a rhizome, which is an open, multiple and
                  temporal form of organization and subsceptible to constant de- and recoding. The act of recording is
                  in one
                  way already a creative act of framing and selection. Any recording is a whole in itself, all its
                  characteristics are immanent to itself, without an essential relation to an outerior or higher
                  symbolic
                  order. <span style="background: lime;">However, up until the 1960s and the expansion of recording
                    studio
                    technologies, record was generally regarded as referring to an original acoustic event, a
                    performance,
                    which would have more ontologic value (i.e. &ldquo;realness&rdquo;) than mere representation of it.
                    Multitrack tape machines make that stance irrelevant; studio-as-instrument does away with acoustic
                    realism. A particular soundscape, experienced as a unified whole, could have been assembled during
                    many
                    different takes and places, or wouldn&rsquo;t have to result from any acoustic events, as in
                    computer
                    music. Through the mixing board and the master tape, the record is the stratified surface of sound.</span></span></p>
                <p>I hear no great conceptual divide between various music machines. Whatever means there are available
                  for
                  recording acoustic phenomena or presenting sound, no matter what the source, making sound
                  reproducible and
                  thus variable, all phonographic technologies have the potential to deterritorialize sound and music.
                  <span style="background: aqua;">Maybe the greatest singular moment in nomadic use (= an act of
                    capturing
                    forces, making a new machinic assemblage of existing machinic formations) of phonographic machinery
                    has
                    been the emergence of hip-hop DJ&rsquo;ing and the misuse of vinyl records, making a pair of
                    turntables
                    into a nomadic war machine.</span> For a better part of the last century the record remained
                  inactive, a
                  storage capsule of time.</span></p>
                <p>Apart from few artistic experimentations vinyl records were used as passive playback devices which
                  always
                  referred to some original event captured onto the grooves of the disc. In a parallel to the
                  reinvention of
                  the electric guitar by finding the aesthetic potential of the feedback noise generated by the
                  guitaramplifier -circuit (and thus making electric guitar something other than an amplified replica
                  of
                  acoustic guitar), the DJ would find and learn to use the immanent forces within the record itself.</span></p>
                <p>Radio, a medium which in the early 20</span><sup><span>th</span></sup>&nbsp;Century had a similarly
                  all-pervading role as the internet has today, remained the primary medium of the DJ for a long time.
                  The
                  status of a radio jock rose from that of a salesman/entertainer to a central figure in pop business
                  during
                  the 1950s youth culture explosion. DJ as a sonic artist evolved somewhere else, however: in the&nbsp;<em>discoth&egrave;que</em>,
                  a club for dancing to recorded music instead of a live orchestra. The first discos were born in 1940s
                  France during the German occupation that hampered the live music circuit. After the war some clubs
                  stuck
                  with the concept of dancing to records. This idea migrated elsewhere and in the 50s dance clubs
                  experienced
                  a massive leap in popularity with the advent of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll and youth culture. We can see
                  this
                  as a sort of deterritorialization: <span style="background: lime;">instead of responding to the
                    presence of
                    performers the audience responds to the music and the forces it directs into the space it creates.</span></span></p>
                <p>Disco as a musical style developed from the mantric/tantric heavy funk of James Brown, <span style="background: lime;">followed
                    by others, which concentrated on the bass-heavy, steady and monotonously repetitive groove; a
                    becoming-machine of the rhythm section.</span> This style evolved into even more functionalist
                  direction,
                  downplaying the soul element of funk and delving solely in the groove. Record companies started
                  producing
                  long dance remixes of songs. Disco DJs wanted to create an all-night flow of music and that required
                  a
                  skill of seamlessly mixing records into one another. Any kind of music focusing on rhythm rather than
                  melody could be used; DJ was becoming a curator-figure in the emerging club spaces, such as the loft
                  parties in 1970s New York.</span></p>
                <p>The conceptual leap of DJ from a curator (organizing a collection of works) to an artist (creating a
                  work)
                  happened in 1970s Bronx NY, when local DJs invented the isolating of the breakbeat and hip-hop: they
                  would
                  play only the rhythmic percussion breaks of funk records, alternating the same passage on two
                  turntables,
                  creating their own music. <span style="background: lime;">This rather crude skill of keeping the
                    party
                    going (with the help of an MC hollering encouragements to the party people) soon evolved into finer
                    techniques of vinyl manipulation and collage. </span><span style="background: aqua;">The DJ became
                    a&nbsp;<em>cut chemist.</em></span></span></p>
                <p>Grandmaster Flash&rsquo;s 1981 record&nbsp;<em>The Amazing Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the
                    Wheels
                    of Steel</em>&nbsp;was almost literally an encyclopedia of DJ techniques: crossfading,
                  punch-phrasing,
                  backspinning, cutting and scratching&hellip; Not only percussion was used as a sound source, almost
                  everything could be dropped into the mix, all kinds of noise, as long as it was on record. In some
                  ways a
                  popularization of&nbsp;<em>musique concr&egrave;te</em>, this meant a huge shift in the perception of
                  music:</span></p>

                    engine
                    generating a stereophonics, a hifi consciousness of the head, wholly tuned in and turned on by the
                    found
                    noise of vinyl degeneration that hears scratches, crackle, fuzz, hiss and static as lead
                    instruments.

                  and a

                  diagram, a
                  map, rather than a tracing or writing. A map is entirely oriented toward an experimentation in

                  Scratching
                  deterritorializes the noise on the grooves, bends the spiral grooves into lines of flight; scratching
                  rips
                  its source material from the record, transforms the ideal into matter to be molded, cuts into syntax
                  to
                  isolate words and phrases, achieving an Artaud-style decoding of language systems (both human and

                    that cut it, and creates a vinyl psychedelia =&nbsp;<em>scratchadelia</em>, a machinic refrain, a
                    becoming-vinyl of music.</span></span></p>
                <p>A digital counterpart to the scratch is the often-mentioned glitch. A precariously vague term, which
                  however captures some of the slipperiness of digital media. If analog phonography has led to some
                  sort of
                  metallurgy of sound, made sound malleable and mutable, digital sound processing approaches sound as
                  molecules. The term&nbsp;<em>microsound</em>&nbsp;is very appropriate for the digital music of today.
                  Or,
                  if we take heed of Kim Cascone, we should be talking about post-digital music, since the medium of
                  digital
                  technology has become so transparent it doesn&rsquo;t reflect in the expression of music anymore.
                  Instead
                  specific sound processing tools, such as Max, AudioMulch or SoundForge produce an auratic sound, as
                  well as
                  providing amazing detail and accuracy in manipulating sound.</span></p>
                <p>With glitches, however, electronic music producers embrace the uncertainty John Cage was talking
                  about.
                  Cracked and malfunctioning soft- and hardware, overloaded operating systems, wrong file types opened
                  as
                  sound documents produce unpredictable sounds, sometimes a ghostly unpresence of sounds outside
                  hearing
                  range or gaps in recorded time. Glitches, clicks and cuts are the sound of sound machines
                  molecularizing,
                  atomizing and ionizing sound, making audible the process of sound itself. If we must make a
                  distinction
                  between the scratch and the glitch, it is this: scratching is the folding of recorded time,
                  metallurgy of
                  sound, taking a flow of matter and producing variations of it. Common to music and metallurgy,
                  according to
                  Deleuze and Guattari, is the tendency to &ldquo;bring into its own, beyond separate forms, a
                  continuous
                  development of form, and beyond variable matter, a continuous variation of matter,&rdquo; in short to
                  bring
                  out the &ldquo;life proper to matter.&rdquo; (MP 411)</span></p>
                <p>Glitch, in digital domain, happens on a more abstracted level of decoding that results in
                  molecularized
                  matter. Going beyond the matterform -division (which scratching can be seen starting to evaporate
                  with its
                  variations on matter) the molecularization of sound</span></p>
                <p><span>effects a dissolution of form that connects the most diverse longitudes and latitudes, the
                    most
                    varied speeds and slownesses, which guarantees a continuum by stretching variation far beyond it
                    formal
                    limits. (MP 309)</span></p>
                <p>In both cases, the scratch and the glitch, sound has escaped the overcoding symbolic order of music,
                  or
                  the trancendental plane of organization of the score, in nomadic alliance of man and machines.</span></p>
                <p>James Brown&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Sex Machine</em>&nbsp;and Kraftwerk&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Mensch Maschine</em>define
                  electronic music&rsquo;s identification with machinery with their twin poles of &ldquo;raw&rdquo;
                  physicality and &ldquo;pure&rdquo; spirit/intellect. To dance as mindless robots or to think music as
                  an
                  incorporeal AI. This all-too established dualism has been broken down at times by the music
                  machinery&rsquo;s potential to fuse down the two poles and to break down, to express glitches. Dance
                  music,
                  which might at first thought appear as a musical form most tied up with the reterritorializing
                  function of
                  the refrain, with its strict adherence to certain genre-bound norms, appears however as a machine for
                  liberating sound-in-itself. Rhythm: blocks of sound arranged rhythmically, one after another, one
                  beside
                  another, like the instant pop images of Warhol paintings. Repetition makes the thing repeated (the
                  thing&nbsp;<em>not new</em>&nbsp;anymore) present again. Each repetition (a simulacrum of the
                  &ldquo;original&rdquo;, if any is to be found) is an event in itself;</span></p>
                <p><span>Repetition&nbsp;and&nbsp;first time, but also repetition&nbsp;and&nbsp;last time, since the
                    singularity of any&nbsp;first time&nbsp;makes of it also a&nbsp;last time. Each time it is the
                    event
                    itself, first time is a last time. (Derrida 10)</span></p>
                <p>This repetition, this constant&nbsp;<em>now</em>, can be seen in dance music&rsquo;s lack of drama
                  (or
                  constant crescendo); the changes in music are&nbsp;<em>quantitative</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>qualitative</em>,
                  its narrative is the happening of repetitions. Dance music seeks to build a plateau of intensity. Any
                  vertical, arborescent models are flattened by the rhizomatics of repetition, which undoes the
                  symbolical or
                  critical form of thought. According to Roland Barthes, critique is always either historic or
                  futurologic,
                  its content is culture which equals everything that is inside us,&nbsp;<em>except the present moment</em>&nbsp;(Barthes
                  32).</span></p>
                <p>Electronic dance music sounds astonishingly non-temporal: repetition makes the track happen in the
                  constant now, concentration on the&nbsp;<em>sound of sound</em>&nbsp;(timbre and &ldquo;color&rdquo;
                  and
                  texture, the most difficult-to-remember-afterwards- and the most deterritorializing aspects of sound
                  and
                  music) fades it from the memory. Repetition is a way of appearing without form, without identity: it
                  multiplies the same element over and over again, juxtaposes the element with its each successive
                  re-emergence, brings out the differences by bringing out the&nbsp;<em>gaps</em>&nbsp;between singular
                  repetitions, forms a machinic assemblage out of the circulation of sound blocks. Musical repetition:
                  loops
                  within loops, clashing against each other,&nbsp;<em>loopduelle</em>. The audibility of these
                  juxtapositions
                  is a textuality of differences and differences mark out the repetitions = returnings = soundghosts.</span></p>
                <p>As the repetition builds up a smooth plane of constant present, deterritorializing the sound itself
                  as a
                  singularity, a sonorous force, there&rsquo;s a tendency for that repetition to become
                  reterritorialized as
                  a clich&eacute;, an all-too expectable formula; this seems to be a potential dead-end for numerous
                  genres
                  of electronic dance music. A glitch appears: a wrinkle in time of the constant present. If we listen
                  to an
                  archetypal glitchy sound, an Oval track for example, we can hear a rich tapestry of sound and absence
                  of
                  sound. There are skips, something is missing, there are holes in the smooth space of sound. Or we can
                  consider Kim Cascone&rsquo;s concept of residualism that involves structuring a work around an
                  absence,
                  removing a signal and leaving only its effects to be heard. Scratching, sampling and the stuttering
                  of
                  malfunctioning soft- and hardware are means of derangement, seeking out a way to make a rhizome out
                  of
                  music, a way to place its elements in continuous variation, where absences, breaks, holes, folds and
                  ruptures can be a part; a way to let ghosts of the outside in.</span></p>

                <p>&ldquo;[M]achines work &hellip; by continually breaking down&hellip;&rdquo; (AO 8), producing
                  anti-production, creating gaps and glitches. One has to remember we?re talking about&nbsp;<em>desiring</em>&nbsp;machines
                  and art&rsquo;s ability to reflect the formative processes of machinic pre-conscious world, which is
                  libidinal. As Jake Mandell observes in his liner notes for his album&nbsp;<em>Love Songs for
                    Machines,</em>&nbsp;artists&rsquo;
                  relation to their tools of the trade has always been fetishistic. A favorite pen of the writer, a
                  beloved
                  brush of the painter; it&rsquo;s always been intimate. Mandell writes that the once-close
                  relationship of
                  artists and their tools has encountered a crisis in the digital age, the screenandmouse -interface is
                  abstract and alienating. Still, as an immersive environment, digital media allow for an exceptionally
                  affectionate experience.</span></p>
                <p>As tool-using creatures (among other such creatures) we&rsquo;ve always been cyborgs. &ldquo;[T]ools
                  exist
                  only in relation to the interminglings they make possible or that make them possible.&rdquo; (MP 90)
                  That
                  is to say, tools imply a symbiosis between two bodies in a machinic assemblage, deterritorializing
                  them
                  both. Think of Roland TB-303 Bassline Generator, becoming an Acid Machine through a glitch, a
                  programming
                  mistake, releasing a whole new spectrum of sounds, transforming both the musician and the instrument.
                  It&rsquo;s a two-way relation: we can well take heed of Kodwo Eshun&rsquo;s conception of human
                  beings as
                  the sex organs of synthesizers. New sounds happen between things, in the movement that sweeps you and
                  your
                  computer to somewhere else: in order to effect deterritorializations you have to love your machines.</span></p>

                  paintings
                  poised at the boundary of technology and tradition. It’s some of the best, most beautiful, most
                  sensuous
                  painting (she paints on impervious aluminum, which keeps her pigments slick and vibrant on the

                    Natural Worlds
                  </a></h2>
                <p>by Margot Buermann</p>
                <p>Posted on August 8, 2016</p>
                <p>It’s not hard to become absorbed in Cristi Rinklin’s otherworldly paintings. The artist creates
                  seamless layers of billowing, amorphous forms and sharply defined lines to depict post-human
                  landscapes that appear to hover weightless in space. <span style="background: lime;">These worlds,
                    which take the form of both paintings and installations, are influenced by digital technologies
                    while channeling a grand tradition of illusion in painting. “It is my desire to create paintings
                    and installations that seduce the viewer into believing that the impossible spaces that are
                    presented within them can potentially exist,”</span> the artist says.</p>
                <p>In a statement on her website, Rinklin offers insight to the concepts she explores within her works.
                  “The ability to artificially create a heightened sense of reality has become so advanced that it
                  permeates every aspect of our contemporary visual experience,” she writes. “From cinema, to gaming,
                  to virtual reality, sophisticated imaging systems have created ‘seamless worlds’ that viewers can
                  physically inhabit… When our ability to imagine visual knowledge beyond what we see with our own eyes
                  becomes augmented by this technology, our imaginary vision for what is dramatic, awesome, and sublime
                  becomes re-calibrated. My work is a response to this condition.”</p>
                <p><span style="background: lime;">Rinklin’s creative process involves sourcing images from paintings,
                    internet searches, wallpaper, and photographs to build digital collages, which are translated into
                    oil and acrylic paintings on aluminum canvas. She uses a variety of techniques, including airbrush
                    and stenciling, to create her atmospheric works in which opposing styles are merged together.</span>
                  Rinklin cites Baroque ceiling paintings, American Luminism and 19th century panoramas as stylistic

                    in the Ghost / Static Trapped in Mouths</a></h2>
                <h3>Dichotomies To Be Exploded</h3>
                <p>It is a cliché of early cyber-theory to embrace the transcendental ideal of <span style="background: lime;">disembodied
                    code</span> and run with it. According to this approach, humans are simply data run on wetware. If
                  we
                  could somehow abstract this data and port it to computer hardware, we could upload our souls/selves.
                  <span style="background: lime;">We could become the ghost (dismebodied spirit/code) in the machine
                    (computer
                    hardware).</span> This hope of disembodied immortality is rooted in some specious, idealistic
                  presuppositions about the way computers and humans actually work. Much of "who" humans "are" is
                  inextricably bound to the action of our bodies in lived and present time. Likewise, computers don't
                  execute
                  code in a transcendent, metaphysical vacuum. Code is run on physical hardware in lived and present
                  (albeit
                  massively accelerated) time. Computer code (like human language) may theoretically exist in a
                  timeless
                  transcendental realm, but in order for it to intersect being, it has to be read by and run on
                  something --
                  a person or a computer. The glitch foregrounds and problematizes this myth of pure transcendental
                  data, of
                  pure and perfect signal. The glitch is a perpetual reminder of the immanent, real-time embodiment of
                  executed code.
                  <br><br>
                  The myth that humans can upload their souls is related to the myth of pure signal transference. Both
                  of
                  these myths are derived from residual Platonic dichotomies which need to be exploded. Some of these
                  Platonic dichotomies are:
                  <br><br>
                  immanent | transcendent<br>
                  physical | metaphysical<br>
                  body | spirit<br>
                  hardware | software<br>
                  incarnation | disembodiment<br>
                  <br>
                  in time | out of time<br>
                  lived life | philosophical ideals<br>
                  uttered event | language system<br>
                  emotion/volition | content/meaning<br>
                  <br>
                  present event | memory<br>
                  glitch event | glitch artifact/trace<br>
                  compiled and running code | source code<br>
                  <br>
                  These dichotomies are not binary opposites. They are not even gradual continua transitioning slowly
                  from
                  one extreme to the other. Instead, these extremes are inextricably enmeshed. Furthermore, they are
                  not
                  simply enmeshed (like the contours of an infinity symbol, evenly phasing back and forth between
                  extremes).
                  No, they are much more complicatedly, erratically, and problematically enmeshed (like an abstract
                  diagram
                  of Deleuzean relationships). Furthermore, they are not haphazardly, randomly, or aleatorically
                  enmeshed.
                  No, they are rigorously, fine-grainedly, contingently enmeshed. These extremes intersect and entangle
                  in
                  the ongoing, lived and present moment. This ongoing, lived and present moment is the moment of the
                  glitch
                  and the moment of the utterance.</p>

                <p>By: Mallika Roy</p>
                <h3>what glitch art is and why it matters</h3>
                <p class="marked">The word "glitch" is already loaded with an aesthetic — highly saturated    rainbow stripes and white noise chopping up an image, pixelated video streams in which the subjects' words don't    match up with the audio, shimmering and twitching spots in video games. Although glitches are more often than not
                  met with impatience or annoyance, a growing number of artists are aestheticizing errors from digital
                  or analog sources, either by intentional manipulation or by malfunctions and corruptions like the
                  ones we're already familiar with.</p>

                  <p>As we become more and more wrapped up in technology, glitch art has begun to be taken more
                    seriously as a movement with a unique potential for timely cultural commentary, rather than just an
                    aesthetic embraced by individual artists. Artists began actively connecting around this aesthetic
                    on a larger scale as early as 2002 at the Glitch Symposium and Performance Event held in Oslo, but
                    the medium only picked up serious momentum much more recently: showcases of glitch artists have
                    occurred in several global cities in the past few months alone, from the UK's Tate Britain and
                    Getty Images Gallery, to the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art in Chicago, and, most recently, San
                    Francisco's Dogpatch Cafe & Art Gallery (currently on view until December 12th).</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>data bending - manipulating data files by opening a file of one type in a program designed to
                      open another file (i.e. opening a jpeg in a text application, opening a video in audio processing
                      software, etc.)</li>

                    <li>datamoshing - intentionally distorting media through loss of data during a file compression

                  </ul>
                </p>

                  <p>Glitch art starts conversations that traditional art forms can’t really access, just by the nature
                    of how it's created. <span style="background: lime;">How much do we control our technology, and how much does it control us? Can
                    technology ever transcend the imperfection inherent in its human creators? What does it mean if we
                    can reclaim the “errors” in our computers, phones, and cameras and repurpose them as our tools? The
                    essence of glitch art is pretty simple: humans subject themselves to technology and exert control
                    over it to a greater or lesser extent to produce a piece of artwork that is a product of both the
                    creator’s intention and the device’s whims. There are themes inherent in this medium, then:
                    morbidity and destruction next to growth and regeneration, conflicts between control and
                    unpredictability, disassembling and re-appropriating the systems that surround us, technological
                    chaos versus human balance — or vice versa.</span></p>

                  <p>Because of these inherent themes, glitch art has the potential to comment on more than just an
                    artist’s interaction with the technology in her pocket. The conversations it catalyzes transfer
                    easily over to our contemporary relationships to the cities we live in, and glitch art is able to
                    explore the balance of control between us and the institutions in which we are immersed. The
                    narrative of Detroit’s art culture that we see running through national and international media,
                    for example, builds on many of the themes that glitch art addresses — destruction versus
                    revitalization, human processes versus those determined for us, systemic failings versus make-shift
                    solutions — but this narrative is severely limited since it’s perpetuated by those from outside the
                    city. For instance, there are some definite thematic connections between Detroit ruin porn — which
                    somehow continues to fascinate the media — and glitch art; the former is cringe-worthy in its
                    presentation and is almost always produced by someone outside of the city, but Detroit artists
                    could use the medium of the glitch to react to, engage with, promote or criticize similar themes in
                    a way that is resident-centered and still part of a national and international conversation.</p>

                  <p>In her article Patchwork Hedrons, Lana Polansky explains glitch art's roots in Dada and punk
                    ideologies with regards to the “repurposing and deliberate corruption of materials, impropriety,
                    declarations of radicalism” and the “systemic dismantling” achieved through art; with these
                    ideologies in mind, Detroit art communities — especially those inclusive of young people who are
                    already equipped with technological know-how — could stand to affect the glitch art movement on the
                    whole, as well as change the narrative of the city in outside media if they begin utilizing
                    innovative glitch art processes.</p>

                  <h3>assessing the process</h3>

                  <p>There's a unique relationship between the artist and her medium in creating glitch art, one that
                    goes beyond the interaction between an illustrator and her pen, or a painter and her canvas.
                    Illustrations, paintings, sculptures, industrial design, gifs, textiles — these mediums require a
                    mastery of different tools that the artist ultimately wields with a high level of control (if they
                    are considered “good” at their medium). Since these more conventional forms of art allow for the
                    artist to take full ownership, responsibility, and control during the art-making process, the final
                    product is the most developed and intentional form of communication between the artist and
                    audience. In other words, the final aesthetic almost always reigns supreme while the artist’s
                    process is secondary. Glitch artists, on the other hand, use a medium that plays an active role in
                    determining the final piece of art. The artist’s lack of control and the device’s unpredictability
                    are key aspects in the production of the work; the artist hands over a part of the art-making
                    process to the device and allows the glitch to take the reins.</p>

                  <p>For this reason, the final aesthetic of a piece of glitch art is not the only thing that matters.
                    In glitch art, the process of the creation of the artwork means as much as the final product, and
                    determines what can be considered true glitch art versus art that looks glitchy. Take Instagram,
                    for example. Instagram filters affect a user’s uploaded image with an orange or red flare across
                    the picture, a sunny tinge to the image, a too-bright or too-dark representation of the original.
                    These filters all emulate a glitch that occurs in film cameras. When these effects appear on photos
                    developed from actual, real film, it means that there was a light leak in the camera that affected
                    the exposure of the film. Inducing camera glitches manually in order to produce photos subjected to
                    the whim of the camera itself definitely falls under the umbrella of glitch art. Meanwhile, there
                    are over 200 million Instagram users who have the capability of making a boring picture a little
                    more interesting with the click of a button that mimics light leaks from an interaction between a
                    manual camera and its lens. So although the aesthetic of an image produced by an Instagram user
                    might actually be similar to a photo developed through hacking the film exposure process or light
                    sensor, only one of these uses a process that demands a level of innovation, intention, and
                    commitment to the artist’s camera. While the person tinkering with the camera reclaims the device’s
                    errors and comments on the balance of control between the artist and the tool, the Instagram user
                    remains a slave to technology and therefore makes no contribution in terms of glitch art.</p>

                  <p>Similarly, we as the audience can look at any given piece with a glitchy aesthetic and give
                    ourselves over to the beautiful lines, eye-moving flow, stark contrast, and poetic movement in the
                    piece, only to find out that it was generated through an app or site like this. If an artist
                    uploads a random, unappealing image that has no meaning to them, and it rearranges the pixels, adds
                    noise, chops it up, and spits it out according to either a glitch or a genius algorithm determined
                    by someone else, then the maker of the site or facilitator of the glitch effect should get the
                    credit, not the "artist” who uploaded the image. The question of how an artist is putting the
                    "glitch" in "glitch art" matters for us to understand their level of interaction and intention with
                    the final product, since the final piece's glitchiness doesn't quite relay that information to us.
                    As glitch artist Daniel Temkin explains:</p>

                  <blockquote>“How visually glitchy the results look depends much on the initial image and is not
                    necessarily important to the piece. However, as new work is built … perhaps the glitch itself will
                    become less important as a visual clue that it builds on this history of experiments in
                    human/machine interaction.”</blockquote>
                  <p>So the process of the artist differentiates what glitch art is and what it isn’t. Once an artist
                    has utilized their tool of choice — a faulty computer algorithm, a tampered-with camera, software
                    used to open an incompatible file type — with a level of intention and interaction, how can we
                    decide if it’s good glitch art? Destruction versus regeneration, chaos versus control, and other
                    themes discussed in the previous section attach themselves to the medium just by way of the
                    processes used to create the artwork. If there is a foundation of themes already connected to
                    glitch artists’ work solely by nature of it being glitch art, what does a piece of innovative
                    glitch art look like?</p>

                  <h3>finding the narrative</h3>

                  <p>A piece of glitch art with a unique and developed narrative beyond the default concepts that drive
                    the medium as a whole becomes very valuable because it helps push the boundaries of what we can
                    expect from the movement as a whole. There are all kinds of possibilities here. Plummer Fernandez
                    uses 3D printing to produce sculptures created from glitched images of everyday objects, commenting
                    on the way our vessels reflect and connect all cultures; Tom Cabrera strategically employs scanner
                    glitches to alter body anatomy and architectural forms, in order to “transform what is known to
                    address the unknown”; Way Spurr-Chen developed a Twitter bot called Pixel Sorter that interacts
                    with users (and even exchanges glitched images with other Twitter bots), the implications of which
                    could be the subject of an essay on its own — a human creates a robot that develops its own social
                    media network of over 1500 followers by predictably glitching photos submitted by human and robot
                    users alike.</p>

                  <p>One narrative that a handful of artists have explored through glitch art is the corruption of
                    memory in an age of technology. Berlin-based Hungarian artist David Szaudr, also known as Pixel
                    Noizz, has an ongoing series entitled Failed Memories in which he affects the faces in photo
                    portraits, through intentional manipulation of individual pixels and corrupted algorithms that
                    disassemble the portraits over a length of time. This strategic erosion of photo portraits comments
                    on the passing of time as it affects our understanding of memories and attempts to visualize the
                    memory process as images that were once clear in our minds inevitably disintegrate.</p>

                  <p>Kon Trubkovich's exploration of one second of a home video called Leap Second dives into this
                    arena as well. Currently based in Brooklyn, he paints paused film stills of his mother from one
                    second of a home video documenting his family’s final party in the U.S.S.R. before their
                    immigration to the United States. For one thing, this introduces the medium of painting into the
                    discussion of glitch art. The process of recreating television white noise through oil on linen
                    takes the electronically-captured moment entirely out of its context and subjects it to
                    Trubkovich’s human touch, allowing him to both regain control of the moment as well as to revel in
                    the loss of imagery distorted by film that he is now unable to access. This series also gives
                    Trubkovich permission to explore in excruciating depth just one second of a period of total
                    transition for his family, showing the psychological power that technology holds over us as it
                    becomes the only source through which we can revisit our past.</p>

                  <p>The subjects in Trubkovich’s and Szaudr’s work aren’t entirely visually abstracted — the viewer is
                    able to glean details to a greater or lesser extent about each piece’s subject, through the
                    glitched glimpse of an expression on a face or details in clothing. Canadian artist Mathieu
                    St-Pierre’s Melting Ice Cream series, on the other hand, often completely abstracts his original
                    subject in favor of a reimagined version of the memory. In an interview with Hot ‘N’ Gold Magazine,
                    he explains his use of HD videos of his wife that he experimented with through an editing program
                    to create vibrant landscapes with no discernible human features. These images, full of life and
                    joy, comment on the visual associations that might replace or trigger actual memories; rather than
                    focusing on the void created by the complete distortion of memory, he creates a beautiful new
                    narrative from these memories that stands completely on its own, removed from the boundaries of its
                    original source.</p>

                  <p>Szaudr, Trubkovich, and St-Pierre all use the glitch process and aesthetic to explore the creation
                    and maintenance of memories. This is a powerful use of the medium that pushes the usual narrative
                    attached to any old glitch art. When we capture memories through electronic devices, are those
                    moments impenetrable from the erosion of the human mind? What happens when the technology we've
                    entrusted with our most meaningful memories fails us? When we document experiences with technology
                    of the moment, and later revisit these crudely-rendered experiences, are we remembering the pixels
                    or the event itself — is this what memories of the millennial generation will look like? These are
                    just a few examples of the kinds of meaningful narratives that can be evoked through different
                    manipulations of glitch art processes. It takes real innovation within any medium to unearth
                    probing questions in the minds of viewers; artists like these help forge broader notions of the
                    possibilities of glitch art and push us forward into new philosophical territory through their
                    work.</p>

                  <h3>shaping the movement’s direction</h3>

                  <p>We have the chance to actively shape the direction of what may very well become a significant
                    period of art included in history books down the line; glitch art can comment on our increasing
                    reliance on technology in a specific and relevant way that goes beyond the capability of
                    conventional art forms. Artists are mapping the glitch aesthetic onto furniture, street art,
                    fashion, textiles, and more. We’ve got to know how to be an effective audience (and, for some of
                    us, an effective contributor) to the glitch art movement as the aesthetic starts to appear in
                    public spaces, art galleries and museums; we need to look critically at glitch art in all its
                    forms, to engage with it and judge it, to decide if we are annoyed or inspired by different claims
                    in the glitch art arena, and to make the call for ourselves if a piece has meaning or not.

                    <p>Cities, then, have an important role as the art movement progresses. Many cities across the
                      world are already playing their part, providing outlets to access glitch art beyond computer
                      screens. Detroit and other cities whose representation in the media leaves residents’ voices out
                      of the picture have a stake in investing in this medium; Detroit galleries and artist collectives
                      should work to strategically foster a glitch art culture in the city, whether through
                      skill-sharing, public showcases, or simply providing feedback on the art movement as a whole. By
                      experimenting with glitch processes, Detroit artists and others could potentially repurpose some
                      of the narrow existing narratives of their cities and gain a prominent positive national and
                      international voice through the glitch art movement as it progresses.</p>

                <p>by Ryan Hagemann</p>
                <p>November 17, 2016</p>
                <p>Like many people, I’ve recently become a huge fan of HBO’s <i>Westworld</i>, a new sci-fi series
                  that
                  mashes a lot of <i>Blade Runner</i> with a bit of <i>Jurassic Park</i>. The gist of the story
                  revolves
                  around an amusement park-style operation where customers (the guests) experience a Wild West setting
                  populated by highly advanced robots (the hosts). AI, robotics, and automation are at the core of the
                  series, but one of the central themes also revolves around the nature of “consciousness.” This, I
                  think, is
                  one of the key factors driving confusion about the power of AI in the real world: the distinction (or
                  lack
                  thereof) between “intelligence” and “consciousness.</p>
                <p>Separating out the concerns over an impending SkyNet future is no small task. Popular media has
                  enshrined
                  the bipedal <i>Terminators</i> of James Cameron’s eponymously-titled movies as the inevitable outcome
                  of
                  developments in AI. Many see this as the future this technology will engender. For others, the
                  concerns are
                  simply about the decision trees and algorithmic transparency—that is, if we don’t know how <i>it
                    works</i>,
                  we can’t know how <i>it will fail</i>. Intuition matters in how humans interpret information. For AI,
                  intuition is scarce and even more inscrutable than it is among humans. Since AI is, in the narrowest
                  form,
                  attuned to data sets and not facts about the broader world, it makes extracting general rules about
                  how
                  neural networks and machine learning algorithms operate difficult.</p>
                <p>Yet many fail to realize that every time we use Google’s search, we’re using a very narrow,
                  task-specific
                  form of AI. “As soon as it works,” the famed computer scientist John McCarthy once quipped, “no one
                  calls
                  it AI anymore.” </p>
                <p>The need for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/understanding-artificial-intelligence-decisions/?mbid=social_fb">algorithmic
                    accountability</a> will likely be compounded as this technology becomes more and more a part of
                  everyday
                  life, and everyday decisions. How precisely we achieve that level of transparency and accountability
                  is
                  still unknown, however. At this point in its development, AI is still a “black box.” Until we can <a
                    href="https://medium.com/niskanen-center/why-robot-ad319cb005c#.amgc5fdlj">figure
                    out how to get these systems to “talk” to us</a>—that is, more effectively disclose the rationale
                  behind
                  the outcomes they report—accountability will remain elusive. Nonetheless, we should not let that
                  hurdle
                  blind us to the many benefits this technology will deliver to society.</p>
                <p>As discussed in <a href="https://www.datainnovation.org/2016/10/data-detractors-are-wrong-the-rise-of-algorithms-is-a-cause-for-hope-and-optimism/">a
                    recent report from the Center for Data Innovation</a>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><i>Because AI will continue to evolve and work its way into a wide variety of applications, it is
                      difficult to predict just how much value AI will generate. The International Data Corporation
                      estimates
                      that in the United States the market for AI technologies that analyze unstructured data will
                      reach $40
                      billion by 2020, and will generate more than $60 billion worth of productivity improvements for
                      businesses in the United States per year. Investors in the United States are increasingly
                      recognizing
                      the potential value of AI, investing $757 million in venture capital in AI start-ups in 2013,
                      $2.18
                      billion in 2014, and $2.39 billion in 2015. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2025
                      automating knowledge work with AI will generate between $5.2 trillion and $6.77 trillion,
                      advanced
                      robotics relying on AI will generate between $1.7 trillion and $4.5 trillion, and autonomous and
                      semi-autonomous vehicles will generate between $0.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion. A report from
                      Accenture
                      examining the potential impact of AI on economic growth found that by 2035, AI could increase the
                      annual growth rate of the U.S. and Finnish economies by 2 percentage points, the Japanese economy
                      by
                      1.9 points, and the German economy by 1.6 points. The report also found that, for the 12
                      countries
                      surveyed, AI would boost labor productivity rates by 11 to 37 percent.</i></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The economic benefits from this technology are clearly poised to be enormous. Of course, the
                  possibility
                  of an AI-driven economy leads to other, less <i>Terminator</i>-style concerns. More realistic
                  concerns are
                  neither about killer robots or algorithmic transparency, but the issue of an economy of ghosts in the
                  machine. The popular video game series <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> actually touches on this.</p>
                <p>The series revolves around a central cadre of characters fighting a complex web of foes tied
                  together by
                  unseen forces that are slowly revealed to be advanced AIs. Originally constructed to unite the
                  nations of
                  the world, the systems end up becoming the very reasons for which war is waged. Over the course of
                  many
                  decades, these AIs eventually transform the world by inducing a “war economy.” The global economic
                  structure, reengineered by algorithmic optimization, turn conflict into a lucrative business that
                  drives
                  whole state economies to become dependent on never-ending war. By creating everlasting enemies, the
                  AIs are
                  able to accomplish the goals set forth by their progenitors: a world without ideological priors,
                  principles, or ideals, united in a common pursuit of perpetual warfare.</p>
                <p>This might lead us to conclude that the real concern, then, is not so much a future of <i>Terminators</i>,
                  <span style="background-color:lime">but a future of ghosts in the machine, a la <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>.
                    Realistically, however, neither situation appears likely for humankind’s near-term future.
                    Nevertheless,
                    policymakers will soon have to confront these issues; and when they do, they should begin with
                    regulatory
                    forbearance, while avoiding doomsaying language. The AIs of science fiction and Hollywood are a far
                    cry
                    from the reality of the day. Fanciful portents of dystopian future make for good clickbait and even
                    better blockbuster hits, but they shouldn’t serve as the basis for informed policies governing
                    developing
                    technologies.</span></p>
                <p><b>Safeguarding Advancements in Artificial Intelligence</b></p>
                <p>Depending on the particular use and application of AI, there are many recommendations to be offered.
                  However, for the time being, the 115th Congress and incoming Administration should embrace regulatory
                  forbearance as the ideal starting point for any future conversation about federal rulemaking. I
                  argued as
                  much in a July comment filing to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on the matter of
                  artificial intelligence (see the full comments <a href="https://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CommentsArtificialIntelligencePolicyOSTP.pdf">here</a>).
                  In those comments, I argued that OSTP and federal regulators should:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Avoid speaking of hyperbolic hypothetical doomsday scenarios; and </li>
                  <li>Embrace a policy of regulatory restraint, intervening in the development and use of AI technology
                    only
                    when and if the prospect of harm becomes realistic enough to merit government intervention.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>However, there are a number of other recommendations worth considering given the policy fissures
                  likely to
                  emerge on perennial issues like privacy and cybersecurity. The following general recommendations
                  should
                  serve as a starting point for regulators and policymakers thinking about this issue:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Any agencies considering regulations specific to AI (though generally applicable to any new
                    emerging
                    technology representing a unique regulatory knowledge gap) need to focus on <i>tangible</i> and <i>known</i>
                    costs and benefits, not hypotheticals;</li>
                  <li>Government can be positive contributor to developments in AI by increasing public funding for
                    research
                    into interdisciplinary analyses of the economic and social ramifications of future developments;
                  </li>
                  <li>Avoid any singular, mandatory development standards for safety (such as the Food and Drug
                    Administration’s mandatory regime for medical software of “high consequence”); and</li>
                  <li>Promote industry self-regulation as a first step towards developing best practices and standards
                    in AI
                    research. This would ideally materialize in the form of independent, third-party validators and
                    open-source developers (such as <a href="https://openai.com/about/">OpenAI</a>) or industry
                    consortiums
                    (such as <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/">The Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to
                      Benefit
                      People and Society</a>), not as legislative fiat or prescriptive mandates imposed by regulators
                    or
                    other government actors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, the best policy recommendations for promoting innovation in AI will rely on flexible
                  regulatory
                  frameworks. Government can be a valuable ally in helping to accelerate the development and deployment
                  of
                  this technology, but it should not stand as a gatekeeper to the future. As noted in <a href="https://ai100.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ai_100_report_0831fnl.pdf">the
                    first report from Stanford University’s <i>One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence</i></a>,
                  initiative, policies can and should “strengthen a virtuous cycle of activity involving internal and
                  external accountability, transparency, and professionalization, rather than narrow compliance.”
                  Additionally, any policy developments should be continually reevaluated as new challenges emerge. A
                  one-size-fits-all ex ante methodology of precautionary regulation simply will neither foster this
                  industry’s development or maximize beneficial outcomes for society.</p>
                <p><b>Accelerating the Autonomous Roadway</b></p>
                <p>Perhaps the most pressing application of AI—and one of the leading technological applications
                  driving
                  public fears of this field—is already unfolding around us. Driverless cars are already hitting the
                  roads,
                  from Pittsburgh to the streets of Mountain View, and even around the world. The United States, if it
                  wishes
                  to maintain its lead in this emerging space, as well as reap the benefits from ongoing innovations,
                  needs
                  to create an environment of regulatory certainty. In upcoming comments to the National Highways
                  Traffic
                  Safety Administration (NHTSA) on its Federal Autonomous Vehicle Policy Guidelines, I argue against
                  some of
                  the guidelines’ newly proposed authorities and expanded interpretation of existing authorities. </p>
                <p>NHTSA itself notes that: “Substitution of pre-market approval for all standards for which
                  manufacturers
                  currently self-certify would be a wholesale structural change in the way NHTSA regulates motor
                  vehicle
                  safety and would require both fundamental statutory changes and a large increase in Agency
                  resources.” This
                  is problematic. While it is understandable that the agency would argue for structural changes to
                  assist in
                  their efforts to address concerns from a new technology like this, it is unclear that a “large
                  increase in
                  Agency resources” would yield more optimal outcomes. Alternatively, this is an area where the 115th
                  Congress can potentially lead, reasserting its legislative authority to address the issue of
                  autonomous
                  vehicles and federally preempt any disconcerting legislation coming from states and localities.</p>
                <p>Promoting an expeditious and effective deployment of this technology is important in order to
                  actualize
                  the social and economic benefits associated with autonomous vehicles, to say nothing of the tens of
                  thousands of lives that could be saved.</p>
                <p><b>Why the Time For Action is Now</b></p>
                <p>Autonomous vehicles are but one case study in how advancements in AI have helped usher in a new era
                  of
                  technological progress. As AI is incorporated into developments in headline-grabbing technologies,
                  public
                  attention is naturally becoming more focused on developments in this space. We all walk around with
                  task-specific AI in our phones (Siri, Cortana, etc.) and utilize virtual private assistants, voice
                  recognition technology, Google Translate, and a host of other AI-driven technological conveniences.
                  It’s
                  important, now more than ever, that legislators and Administration officials take the lead in
                  continuing to
                  examine developments in this technology, while foregoing ex ante regulatory measures. As AI continues
                  to
                  drive developments in other technologies, the potential for bad regulatory action could stymie not
                  only
                  autonomous vehicles, but numerous other technologies—some not yet even imagined—that could hold the
                  potential to improve the lives of millions of Americans. &nbsp;</p>

                    rel="noopener noreferrer">The Concept of Mind</a></h2>
                <p>The Concept of Mind is a 1949 book by philosopher Gilbert Ryle, in which the author argues that
                  "mind" is
                  "a philosophical illusion hailing chiefly from René Descartes and sustained by logical errors and
                  'category
                  mistakes' which have become habitual." The work has been cited as having "put the final nail in the
                  coffin
                  of Cartesian dualism" and has been seen as a founding document in the philosophy of mind, which
                  received
                  professional recognition as a distinct and important branch of philosophy only after 1950.<p>
                    <p>In the chapter "Descartes' Myth," <span style="background-color:lime">Ryle introduces the term
                        "the
                        dogma of the Ghost in the machine" to describe the philosophical concept of the mind as an
                        entity
                        separate from the body.</span> He argues, "I hope to prove that it is entirely false, and false
                      not
                      in detail but in principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one big
                      mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category mistake."</p>
                    <p class="marked">This is not what I want to write about, but it's important for contextualization,
                      to

                <p>Human–machine system is a system in which the functions of a human operator (or a group of
                  operators) and
                  a machine are integrated. This term can also be used to emphasize the view of such a system as a
                  single

                <p>(...)</p>
                <p>The area of human–machine choreography is yet to be extensively explored. How body-structure can be
                  extended through machine mechanisms points to how the body can perform beyond its biological form and
                  functions as well as beyond the local space it inhabits. How human movement is transduced into

                  motion and then can be both expressed and extended into virtual performance on the web promises new
                  possibilities in both conceptual approach and aesthetic application. For example, incorporating
                  virtual

                <p>That’s something no one will forget. It’s a McQueen performance, a coup de théâtre that has made
                  ever-living history, surely up there among the top 10 fashion show thrills of all time. No matter how
                  many
                  times you play it on video, the rawness and shock of it never diminishes: Harlow standing on a wooden
                  turntable, flailing her beautiful arms above her head, protecting herself as the programmed machinery
                  goes
                  in, gunning at her with black and neon yellow paint. Around and around, woman against machine. It’s
                  poignant, but it’s sexual too. Harlow was a ballet dancer; you see it in her. “She did exactly what
                  she
                  wanted to do,” says Sam Gainsbury, who produced the show with her partner Anna Whiting. “We couldn’t
                  rehearse it. She knew how to keep her center on the turntable because she was a dancer. She didn’t
                  flinch
                  when they came near her face. It was completely spontaneous.”</p>

                <p>by Taina Bucher</p>
                <p><strong>Upcoming</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="http://gli.tc/h">Gli.tc/h</a>&nbsp;noise &amp; new media
                  festival, September 28 thru October 3, 2010. The international conference and gathering will take
                  place in
                  Chicago to celebrate the aesthetics of the glitch.</p>
                <p>A glitch is a short-lived digital or analog error. Such errors mostly occur when there is some sort
                  of
                  mistranslation in the transmission of data between different domains in a computational system. A
                  visual
                  glitch is not the error itself, but its visual manifestation of it. They appear as a malfunction (a
                  voltage-change or signal of the wrong duration) in an electrical circuit. In software a glitch is
                  something
                  unpredictable, something that changes the desired or expected output of the system. Things go wrong.
                  I
                  think Olga Goriunova and Alexei Shulgin describe what a glitch is all about in a nice way in their
                  contribution to the&nbsp;<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476">Software
                    Studies lexicon</a>: &ldquo;A glitch is a mess that is a moment, a possibility to glance at
                  software&rsquo;s inner structure&hellip;it shows the ghostly conventionality of the forms by which
                  digital
                  spaces are organized&rdquo;.</p>
                <p>The unexpected and the dysfunctional nature of the glitch lend itself well for artistic
                  explorations.
                  Glitch aesthetics is the visualization or making visible of errors, it is a way of organizing
                  perception
                  that emphasizes the artificiality of representation. The aesthetics of glitch makes the functionality
                  and
                  dysfunctionality of software appear. It interrupts the event and breaks down the expected.</p>
                <p>Glitch art is an art form that plays with these manifestations of errors, these ruptures and cracks.
                  According to artist&nbsp;<a href="http://rosa-menkman.blogspot.com/search/label/GlitchStudiesManifesto">Rosa
                    Menkman</a>, glich art shows how destruction can change into the creation of something original.
                  Glitch
                  art is not just about errors produced deliberatively by the artists but also about a way of
                  expression that
                  depends on multiple actors contributing to the creation of unexpected events in computational
                  systems.
                  Menkman describes her artistic practice in producing glitch art as uncanny and sublime. &ldquo;The
                  artist
                  tries to catch something that is the result of an uncertain balance, a shifting, un-catchable,
                  unrealized
                  utopia connected to randomness and idyllic disintegrations&rdquo;. She says: &ldquo;I manipulate,
                  bend and
                  break any medium towards the point where it becomes something new&rdquo;.</p>
                <p>The artist&nbsp;<a href="http://nickbriz.com/">Nick Briz</a>&nbsp;compares glitch art to cubism. The
                  logic
                  of cubism he says is that of reducing natural forms into its basic geometric constituencies, glitch
                  art
                  does something similar by attempting to expose the algorithmic processes into an aesthetic form.
                  Glitch art
                  also resembles pop art in his view. Like pop art, glitch art shows an interest in popular culture by
                  appropriating it. What&rsquo;s being appropriated are the errors occurring in software, video games,
                  images, videos, audio and other forms of data. Unlike Menkman, Briz seems to think that artists
                  primarily
                  search the digital landscape in order to catch, grab and record a glitch, rather than intentionally
                  create
                  them.</p>
                <p>The question is whether a glitch is still a glitch, that is an unexpected result of a malfunction,
                  if it
                  is intentionally created? Is it possible to make a mistake on purpose and still call it a mistake?</p>
                <p>One of the most prominent glitch theorists,&nbsp;<a href="http://oculasm.org/glitch">Iman Moradi</a>,
                  distinguishes in his&nbsp;<a href="http://oculasm.org/glitch/download/Glitch_dissertation_print.pdf">dissertation</a>&nbsp;between
                  the &ldquo;pure glitch&rdquo; of the unexpected malfunction and the &ldquo;glitch-alike&rdquo; which
                  is a
                  result of an intentional human decision. Moradi together with Ant Scott, Joe Gilmore and Chrisopher
                  Murphy
                  just last year published one of the first&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glitch-Designing-Imperfection-Iman-Moradi/dp/0979966663">books</a>&nbsp;(if
                  not the first) solely devoted to glitch aesthetics &ndash; to the art of loss of information, the
                  frozen
                  uncertainty, and the revenge of the machine.</p>

                    Ghost in the Machine</a></h2>
                <p>By Josephine Wolff <br>May 6, 2015 9:30 am</p>
                <p>The month after my grandmother died, I received several emails from her. Not from her, of course,
                  but from
                  an old AOL email account of hers that had been taken over by spammers. My mother and other family
                  members
                  called to ask me &mdash; the granddaughter who studies computer security &mdash; to make the emails
                  stop.
                  We were all strangely unsettled by these messages from beyond the grave, by my grandmother&rsquo;s
                  sudden
                  appearance in our inboxes so soon after we&rsquo;d lost her. More than just spam, this felt like a
                  ghost in
                  the machine.</p>
                <p>To my grandmother, born in 1927, everything about computers and the Internet had seemed slightly
                  supernatural. A writer for more than 60 years, she understood that being a professional in this day
                  and age
                  &mdash; selling books and articles, communicating with publishers and agents, editing and revising
                  &mdash;
                  required using a computer. And so she did.</p>
                <p>But she regarded machines with suspicion and mistrust. Above all, she felt a deep sense of despair
                  that
                  something cataclysmic and irreparable had happened whenever she couldn&rsquo;t find the Firefox icon
                  (which
                  she referred to as Foxfire), or open an email attachment. She would call me and say woefully:
                  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent all day looking for the story I was writing and it&rsquo;s completely
                  disappeared.
                  I don&rsquo;t know what I did. I&rsquo;ve broken the Internet.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>How ironic that she should have an afterlife on that same Internet she was so sure she had broken.
                  Nowadays, online ghosts and Internet afterlives are not just for those with big digital footprints
                  and
                  major social media lives but even for my grandmother, who considered it a major achievement to find
                  the
                  send button in her email. And if she thought the Internet was magic &mdash; good magic or malevolent
                  magic
                  &mdash; perhaps it&rsquo;s also oddly fitting that it should be some 21st-century version of beyond
                  the
                  veil, our gateway to the spirit world.</p>
                <p>Magical or not, my grandmother struggled mightily with the computer. It got harder as her eyesight
                  deteriorated and she was both increasingly unable to navigate the screen and increasingly prone to
                  frustration. Na&iuml;ve digital native that I am, I periodically believed I could fix her problems
                  with a
                  well-placed technological intervention.</p>
                <p>In 2010, I set up a&nbsp;<a href="https://blogginggrandma.com/">blog</a>&nbsp;for her (tagline:
                  &ldquo;Five years older than the A train&rdquo;) so she could continue writing for an audience even
                  as it
                  got harder for her to navigate the world of professional publishing. In the summer of 2012, I
                  persuaded her
                  to buy an enormous 27-inch iMac and set it up in her apartment, magnifying the cursor and the text
                  and the
                  icons so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to strain her eyes. I created an iChat account that would launch
                  automatically and set it so that I could take control of her desktop remotely, using my own account,
                  whenever something went wrong.</p>
                <p>On some level, I understood even then that there was no technology that could make up for going
                  blind,
                  nothing that would make that loss less acute or painful or resented &mdash; but I put everything I
                  could
                  think of into that computer, making it so big and simple and user-friendly that maybe, just maybe,
                  while
                  writing on its enormous screen, in type magnified by 400 percent, she would forget that she could no
                  longer
                  read a newspaper or easily navigate the city where she had lived almost her entire life.</p>
                <p>There were still lots of despairing phone calls, only now I could hang up the phone and connect
                  directly
                  to her computer from my own laptop, 200 miles away, talking to her and moving her mouse from afar,
                  telling
                  her, when she asked, bewildered, where my voice was coming from, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;m in
                  the
                  computer.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>And then, suddenly, she was the one in my computer &mdash; and not just because of the creepy emails
                  that
                  arrived so soon after her death. In the year since my grandmother died, I have inherited some items
                  she
                  loved &mdash; jewelry, clothing, books, refrigerator magnets in the shape of Popsicles &mdash; and
                  also,
                  inevitably, that computer, which now lives on my desk in Cambridge, with her usernames and passwords
                  still
                  scrawled in her shaky, oversize handwriting on scraps of paper taped to the screen, with the font and
                  icons
                  still magnified, and the blog post she was only 200 words into when she went to the hospital still
                  saved on
                  the desktop.</p>
                <p>I&rsquo;m sometimes startled by how powerfully that computer evokes my grandmother for me. As a
                  break from
                  my own work, I often clean out her inbox or go through her documents &mdash; that most intimate of
                  after-death invasions &mdash; and read her words: letters, blog posts, essays, short stories, a
                  novel, bad
                  puns, revision upon revision, endless accidentally created automatic backups and copies. I can almost
                  hear
                  her voice (as she so often heard mine) coming out of the screen, can almost see her painstakingly
                  pecking
                  at her oversize keyboard to correct the typos or finish the latest blog post, can almost appreciate
                  what a
                  mystical machine it must have seemed to her.</p>
                <p>These days, I use the computer mostly to work on my dissertation, which is about how we defend
                  computers
                  against attacks and about the complex interplay and interactions between the kinds of defenses we use
                  (encryption, firewalls, passwords) and the types of defenders involved (organizations, policy makers,
                  software developers). It focuses on the ways we often end up defending computer systems against the
                  wrong
                  things. We mean to protect against theft or fraud but ultimately only manage to protect against short
                  passwords or open ports &mdash; which often turn out to be weak proxies for the real dangers.</p>
                <p>I discuss the misleading rhetoric in which we talk about attackers &ldquo;getting into&rdquo;
                  computers,
                  when in fact, attacks consist of a series of escalating access capabilities. There is no moment at
                  which an
                  attacker is suddenly &ldquo;in&rdquo; a compromised computer.</p>
                <p>I make this argument now on that very same machine from which I regularly announced to my
                  grandmother,
                  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the computer,&rdquo; the same machine that I tried so unsuccessfully to layer
                  with as
                  many defenses as I could against her worsening eyesight and technological despair, the same machine
                  that
                  has slips of paper with her passwords written on them taped to the bottom of the screen because, poor
                  security practice or no, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to throw them away.</p>
                <p>It is at once funny and strange and sad and fitting to write on my grandmother&rsquo;s computer.
                  There&rsquo;s undeniable comedy in the idea that anything of hers should even touch a
                  computer-science
                  dissertation. And, of course, it&rsquo;s bittersweet, still, to look at her handwritten notes below
                  the
                  screen and her archives of years&rsquo; worth of writing and realize all over again, I&rsquo;m never
                  going
                  to get another call that she&rsquo;s broken the Internet, never going to find her Foxfire icon, never
                  going
                  to be inside her computer, never going to talk to her again.</p>
                <p>But the right way to remember my grandmother is to write, so I go back to my dissertation, and I try
                  to
                  channel her dedication, her passion for writing, if not her belief that the machines were out to get
                  her,
                  into my thesis &mdash; she would not have understood a single word, I know, and yet her voice is on
                  every
                  page.</p>

                <p>Fritz Kahn (1888–1968) describes the relationship between man and machine: “[they] exhibit
                  far-reaching similarities. Both derive their energy from the combustion of carbon, which they obtain
                  from plants. Man, the weaker machine, utilizes fresh plants for fuel, while the locomotive, a
                  stronger machine, uses fossilized plants in the form of coal.” Kahn’s modernist visualization of the
                  digestive and respiratory system as "industrial palace," really a chemical plant, was conceived in a
                  period when the German chemical industry was the world’s most advanced.</p>

                <p>(...)</p>
                <p>The name “Glitch Art” is, in itself, a slight misnomer. Many pieces are more intentional than random
                  – Scott’s fascination runs so deep that he is often moved to generate such chaos on his own, by
                  feeding information to computer programs in a form they aren’t meant to receive or manipulate.</p>
                <p>(...)</p>
                <p>How should one read glitch works? Is it important to understand the data sources? As a signifi er
                  of data, glitch art is often so obtuse that most casual viewers would not have the technical savvy to
                  fully understand the processes and sources of the information they are seeing. Some pieces are not
                  explained at all. In this way, glitch art shares some perceivable elitism with that of traditional
                  gallery
                  art practice, but it is a different type of elite – hacker elite.<br><br>
                  Thus, the viewer’s experience with a glitch art piece involves a personal awareness of computing and
                  technology. Some of the work requires just menial technological experience – any child of the 80’s
                  would recognize the familiar blips and digital warps that might arise from an incorrectly-loaded
                  Nintendo cartridge. But the aesthetic and conceptual beauty of a visualized Unix core dump (a copy
                  of the contents of memory used by a computing process) is limited to those with the background
                  to understand it.<br><br>
                  Accessibility (or lack thereof) is unfortunately the pratfall in this work. There is an undeniable
                  voyeuristic
                  potential in the practice of rooting around inside random-access memory, looking for bits of
                  email messages and fragments of images stowed away as distant reminders of the machine’s (and its
                  users’) past. The work is at its most successful when the data alone has some significance, and
                  layers of
                  encoding are decoded, deconstructed, and spread out like scraps. <span style="background-color:lime">The
                    stories that develop are a mash
                    of technical jargon and personal information – it is as if a surgeon has dissected a cyborg’s brain
                    and
                    the viewer has the chance to play connect-the-dots.</span></p>

                    Philosophical Analysis of Ghost in the Shell (1995)</a></h2>

                <p>Date: January 20, 2015</p>
                <p>Author: mogsam</p>

                <p>Ah yes, another article clumsily grappling with philosophical concepts, this time in the context of
                  none other than Ghost in the Shell. For the purpose of the main focus of this article, I’ll start
                  with a refresher.  In this film, a soul is referred to as a “ghost” and the plot is propelled forward
                  by a myth concerning an entirely robotic being containing its own “ghost”. <span style="background-color:lime">This
                    ultimately brings forth questions as to what a “ghost” is and whether artificial lifeforms can
                    possess these “ghosts”. Similarly, it also pushes forward the question of what is inherently unique
                    to humans if robotic beings can mimic something such as a “ghost”. It is immediately apparent that
                    this film presents the idea of dualism; the mind and body are presented as different entities.</span></p>

                <p>Motoko Kusanagi, the main character, and a cyborg, is able to separate from her body and travel
                  through the net on her own accord. When plugged in, she is capable of looking into another ghost or
                  hack into a GPS system without the aid of a physical body. In essence, Motoko’s ghost has the ability
                  to act in such a way that controls her body but at the same time act entirely individually from it.
                  Gilbert Ryle is well-known for his criticism of dualism, a theory presented by Rene Descartes that
                  the mind and body are distinct, with the mind living in some non-physical plane. Ryle speaks of how a
                  person’s mind and body influence one another – that while the mind can control various parts of the
                  body to perform certain actions, the body has an equal potential. Ryle says, “…grimaces and smiles
                  betray the mind’s moods and bodily castigations lead, it is hoped, to moral improvement”. Now of
                  course, applying this unique situation of the “ghost” of a cyborg implies different circumstances. It
                  is unknown as to whether robotic beings or even cybrogs can have what could be considered a soul.
                  However, I will continue forth with this idea and suggest that in the world of Ghost in the Shell,
                  mind is clearly superior over that of its counterpart.</p>

                <p>Motoko does not act in response to her body, and whatever actions she would react to would be the
                  result of her mental capacities. I believe that with the introduction of a means for the mind to
                  travel through the net, any potential for body and mind to be interwoven together indefinitely is
                  destroyed. Following this train of thought, we run into concepts that sum up Descartes in his
                  entirety. The very notion of “I think therefore I am” is the basis for Motoko’s reasoning that she
                  must be something. However, her reasoning takes it a step further and denotes that memories are
                  something that makes up an individual and that while she may have artificial parts; she has memories
                  that are unique to her.  The following is a conversation she has with a cyborg friend about her
                  thoughts on existence:</p>

                <p>Motoko: Just as there are many parts needed to make a human a human, there’s a remarkable number of
                  things needed to make an individual what they are. A face to distinguish yourself from others. A
                  voice you aren’t aware of yourself. The hand you see when you awaken. The memories of childhood, the
                  feelings for the future. That’s not all. There’s the expanse of the data net my cyber-brain can
                  access. All of that goes into making me what l am. Giving rise to a consciousness that l call “me”.
                  And simultaneously confining ”me” within set limits.</p>

                <p>In this monologue, she considers all of that attributes that extend beyond her mind. By the same
                  kind of logic Descartes follows, Motoko is able to distinguish her body as an attachment to her, such
                  as her hand and her face that differ from others. She focuses a bit more on individuality, namely the
                  memories she alone keeps to herself which make up her ghost. By Descartes’ very own logic, Motoko
                  exists simply because she is able to think for herself and make rational decisions. But the question
                  I ask is whether that might not necessarily be true. Yes, Motoko is able to think and react to events
                  around her while making logical choices. She can deduce information from her surroundings, and go as
                  far as to question her own existence. Nevertheless, she is a cyborg created by a company and even
                  speculates that she may be entirely synthetic with artificially generated memories. More importantly,
                  because she is a cyborg, she is also limited to the manufacturer’s specifications. She acts for the
                  benefit of the company and follows orders knowing very well that should she choose to retire, she
                  must return back her cyborg shell along with any of the memories she may hold.</p>

                <p>The question then is, does Motoko exist as an individual if her thoughts and memories may not even
                  be her own, with the knowledge that they could be programmed artificially and restrain her from
                  thinking freely, and potentially even limiting the kinds of thought she can have. Of course, the
                  other position to consider this conundrum is by strictly following the standard old Descartes’ “I
                  think therefore I am” in its entirety. As long as Motoko is thinking, she exists, no matter who or
                  what the source of these thoughts originate. The moment she decides to retire or happens to be
                  destroyed is the moment she simply no longer exists. It shouldn’t technically matter whether they are
                  her own thoughts or whether they were programmed into her or not.</p>

                <p>The next point of interest is in discussing the nature of the human “soul” and whether there is any
                  more merit from a so-called “soul” than there is from a cyborg’s “ghost”. Here we see this fleshed
                  out a bit further:</p>

                <p>Batou: Ridiculous! You’re merely a self-preserving program!<br>
                  Motoko: By that argument, l submit the DNA you carry is nothing more than a self-preserving program
                  itself. Life is like a node which is born within the flow of information. As a species of life that
                  carries DNA as its memory system, man gains his individuality from the memories he carries. While
                  memories may as well be the same as fantasy it is by these memories that mankind exists. When
                  computers made it possible to externalize memory you should have considered all the implications that
                  held.<br>
                  Batou: Nonsense! No matter what you say you’ve no proof that you’re a life-form!<br>
                  Motoko: lt is impossible to prove such a thing. Especially since modern science cannot define what
                  life is.</p>

                <p>I instantly think of Hume’s bundle theory when I now read over this conversation, which asserts that
                  an object is no more than the collection of its parts and nothing more. Motoko is once again
                  suggesting that life carries its individuality from memories. This can be in the form of DNA or
                  externalized like in computers. With such a heavy emphasis on memories and the implications they have
                  on a being’s actions or thoughts, the same recurring theme is brought to the foreground – the idea
                  that one exists as merely a collection of pieces of experiences and perceptions. From this idea, both
                  humans and computers exist purely through their ability to retain information and call it back up
                  again in the future which is where they seemingly hold the same value.  </p>

                <p>Moving onward from Descartes (there’s a lot of rich philosophical content here) I would like to now
                  focus on Motoko and her peculiar characteristics. She has a deep sense of emotion and awareness of
                  her feelings in response to her environment. In order to get a better of sense of what I’m exactly
                  talking about, I’ll refer to the scene where Motoko is reminiscing about diving in the ocean with the
                  same cyborg friend she spoke to previously:</p>

                <p>Batou: Doesn’t the ocean scare you? lf the floaters stopped working…<br>
                  Motoko: Then l’d probably die. Or would you dive in after me? No one forced you to come out here with
                  me. l just—<br>
                  Batou: So, what’s it feel like when you go diving?<br>
                  Motoko: Didn’t you go through underwater training?<br>
                  Batou: l’m not talking about doing it in a damned pool.<br>
                  Motoko: l feel fear. Anxiety. Loneliness. Darkness. And perhaps, even hope.<br>
                  Batou: Hope? ln the darkness of the sea?<br>
                  Motoko: As l float up towards the surface l almost feel as though l could change into something else.</p>

                <p>Here we can see Heidegger’s ideas come into shape with this kind of thinking. Motoko is apparently
                  concerned with her own existence and enjoys diving because she is able to feel emotions triggered by
                  her sense of fear. Heidegger suggested that because we know that we will die, concern with our
                  annihilation is an ever-present feature of human experience. Motoko shares that concern for her life
                  when she experiences emotions such as revolve around the idea of death. While Motoko cannot die like
                  a normal human being, she is still concerned with existing in her present condition, as a ghost in a
                  shell. She yearns to continue existing rather than yield to any sort of disassembly, which are
                  feeling common to every human being. With the concern about her life and the sensations she feels
                  when faced with the potential for death, it seems that “death is the key to life” is a valid
                  statement to make.</p>

                <p>However, the one aspect of Motoko that is different from the ideas presented by Heidegger is the
                  importance of the question “Why are we here at all?” Clearly, Motoko has a purpose that was created
                  the moment she was created. While she seemingly has the free will of thought and decision, it is only
                  given to her when she fulfills her purpose in the company. She aids in fighting criminal hackers
                  around the nation, but the moment she decides to give up fulfilling such a task she will be
                  terminated. This also leads me full circle to the idea that our lives are shaped by death. Because
                  Motoko is aware of the circumstances that would cause her death, she acts accordingly so that she can
                  live. I think that in the end, whether it is an artificial intelligence, or a human being, one looks
                  for ways to continue existing out of concern for the unknown, the darkness and nothingness that is
                  death.  I think that this will continue to be the state of mind for any being that has the ability to
                  think – it is the inevitability and the curse of having such a capacity for thought. In one form or
                  another, we all seem to contemplate our own existence, left with an eternal sense of wonder and fear
                  concerning the unknown.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Gibson: the man who saw
                    tomorrow</a></h2>
                <p>Neuromancer, 30 years old this month, leapt into cyberspace almost before it existed</p>
                <p>By: Ed Cumming</p>
                <p>Mon 28 Jul 2014 08.00 BST</p>

                <p>Prescience can be tedious for science-fiction writers. Being proven right about a piece of
                  technology or a trend distracts from the main aim of the work: to show us how we live now. William
                  Gibsonknows this as well as anyone. Since the late 70s, the American-born novelist has been pulling
                  at the loose threads of our culture to imagine what will come out. He has been right about a great
                  deal, but mainly about the shape of the internet and how it filters down to the lowest strata of
                  society.</p>
                <p><span style="background: lime;">In Neuromancer, published 30 years ago this month, Gibson
                    popularised the idea of cyberspace: a "consensual hallucination" created by millions of connected
                    computers. This network can be "jacked" into, while in the real world characters flit from Tokyo to
                    the Sprawl, an urban agglomeration running down the east coast of the US.</span> Gritty urban
                  clinics carry out horrendous sounding plastic surgery. A junkie-hacker, Case, is coaxed into hacking
                  the system of a major corporation. What once seemed impossibly futuristic is now eerily familiar.</p>
                <p>"Neuromancer," says novelist and blogger Cory Doctorow, "remains a vividly imagined allegory for the
                  world of the 1980s, when the first seeds of massive, globalised wealth-disparity were planted, and
                  when the inchoate rumblings of technological rebellion were first felt. A generation later, we're
                  living in a future that is both nothing like the Gibson future and instantly recognisable as its less
                  stylish, less romantic cousin. Instead of zaibatsus [large conglomerates] run by faceless salarymen,
                  we have doctrinaire thrusting young neocons and neoliberals who want to treat everything from schools
                  to hospitals as businesses."</p> ￼
                <p><span style="background: lime;">
                    On its release, Neuromancer won the "big three" for science fiction: the Nebula, Philip K Dick and
                    Hugo awards. It sold more than 6m copies and launched an entire aesthetic: cyberpunk. In predicting
                    this future, Gibson can be said to have helped shape our conception of the internet. Other
                    novelists are held in higher esteem by literary critics, but few can claim to have had such a
                    wide-ranging influence. The Wachowskis made The Matrix by mashing Gibson's vision together with
                    that of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard.</span> Stieg Larsson's Lisbeth Salander is a facsimile
                  of Molly Millions, the femme fatale in Neuromancer. Every social network, online game or hacking
                  scandal takes us a step closer to the universe Gibson imagined in 1984.</p>
