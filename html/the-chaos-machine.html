      <p>
        A machine living in another like a parasite.<br>
        Technology and nature are in constant motion. Technology imitating nature. Technology corrupting and restraining nature. But after the death of a machine, nature crawls right back in. A miniature ecosystem can and will take its place.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>lab</h2>
      <p>This is an ongoing experiment. I'm moving my studio to the lab of a lunatic inventor. You are looking at the virtual version of that lab. Please be patient, this is a work in progress.</p>
      <p title="fremdkörper">In the meantime, the robots are getting comfortable in deserted machines.</p>

        "Before I was a Discordian, I took life much too seriously. When you
        take life too seriously you start to wonder what the point of it all is. When
        you wonder what the point is in life, you fall into a trap of thinking there is
        one. When you think there is a point, you finally realize there is no point.
        And what point is there in living like that? Nowadays I skip the search for a
        point and find, instead, the punch lines."

        "From this post and others like it, one gets the sense that Solarpunk’s aesthetic is partly a negative one, defined by what it needs to avoid: Apple’s white-box futurism on one end, and on the other, scary anarchist hackery—as in, the non-utopian possibility if the order of production breaks down. Solarpunk neither wants to fantasize about the Dove-soap- commercial whiteness of the wealthy space settlement in Elysium (which looks a lot like Apple’s Cupertino HQ) nor the wretched, biohacker-ridden, reggaeton-pumping Los Angeles the movie depicts on Earth below. Between the horror of total technological white- box opacity and that of total technological transparency, this particular version of Solarpunk finds a semi-transparent, stained-glass solar panel."</p>
